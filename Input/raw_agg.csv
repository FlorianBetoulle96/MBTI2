Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right? She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She's completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters. OooOK. Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs]  I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, 'Here Comes Treble.' OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND! Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen? [makes frustrated noises] I didn't mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It's... You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna. Why did you do that?! We're on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish. Now? Put the game on hold everyone. It's the new guy. [looks at Jim] See what I mean? WHAT? Are you playing for the other team?! Saboteur! Saboteur!  I'm going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  I'm really going to shoot you. [coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said? Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in. Did you check the vending machine? Did you check your... butt? Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second. Can you stand up? And talk to me over there? I'm acting my heart out here. Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped. I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys? Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey. Seriously, you guys, ask me. Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws. We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I. Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane. From 'Cheers'. You guys ready to party? I said are you ready TO PARTY! Hey, Big Tuna, you ready? One. Two. Three. Shot! Oh, that burns! Golly. Um... One. Two. Three. Shot! [sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children... [sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain. Wait, wait. TUNA! Are you kidding me!! No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin. At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo. Yeah. Big Tuna, tuna? [speechless] Didn't see that coming. Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face! Mmmm.. suck-ah! [surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut! [after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh? Thanks, man. You, too. Totally. [to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out...  [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott. So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines? Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you. What? I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs. Hello. And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello. Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike. Nifty! Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike. Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales. Umm, on the contrary. And I'm a director. Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film? Congratulations. Hey, buddy. Anything new to report? Sure thing, buddy. Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm. Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver. Do you like it? Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way. You're welcome. [sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?'] [sings] What is love? Baby, don't hurt me. Baby, don't hurt me! Whoa-oh-oh-oh Whoa-oh-oh-oh. Oh, probably because of all the nose candy. Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle. Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb. Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon? Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese. Actually, it is. It's Latin for 'earth.' Yeah. Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back. Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came. Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University. If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm. [coughs word] Idiot! [coughs sentence] Nice comeback! [approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard. Nice to meet you. That is a penguin. You like it? Andy, or Andrew. Yeah. Ha, that's why I wore this shirt. Hey Kevin. Have you lost weight? I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner. You're welcome. [gets up] I'll do it. [turns over card] King of hearts. [claps] That was fantastic. It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters. [over phone] I am so horny. Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack. Oh, and I care why? Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that. Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it? Jackpot. All... righty, let's get started. What is she into? Are you kidding? I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf. Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay? Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back. Yeah. I play the banjo. [singing] You know I can, my man. I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car. Wow. Prison sounds horrible. [singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee... Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike. Michael If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her. Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.] Umm... I'm number three. Yeah, but I'm number three. Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat. That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too. No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion] So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table. So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a No. Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help. I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look] One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal. Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you? You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya? This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael] Cindy, Cindy. I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day. This is great. Now open your eyes and describe it to me. [referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding! What? Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy. My new girlfriend. Your hands. I'll use my hands on it. I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in! Boring. Call me if she rolls over. Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell] I give thanks, mon. Hey Dwight, I bet I can stack faster than you can. Oh, yeah? Prove it, champ. You ready? One, two, three, go! Get out of my way, Jim! Dang it. Those aren't straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You're disqualified. Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river. Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael? Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott. Ph. D. Doctor of Sales. Well, it is very gracious of you to accept. Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage. He does your laundry? Bueno. In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down. What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry? Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder. I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know? My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons. Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once. Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York. Oh, man, that is, like, poetry. I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree. Ow. Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper? I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up. I really 'Schruted' it. Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute? Hey boss. Got a minute? I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning? That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something? Oh, doggie. It sure seems like he is lying. Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp. Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good. [to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays 'Rockin' Robin'] All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever. Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing] I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring. Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you. I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience.  So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna... The cost of doing business. Was the top salesman... [chuckles] Addition by subtraction. Mmmm. Yeah you're right. Hey, boss. Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right? Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out? Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going? Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you. [lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss. Feel ya, dawg. Absolutely. You said... [makes gibberish noises] Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it. Oh, no. I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh! 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ['displays' Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed] [singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed. [after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one. Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device? Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call. What's going on? Where is my FREAKING phone?! Maybe you're in the ceiling! [trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis! Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with? Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own. Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that. Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good? Sure? Okay. So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so. Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy! It's so good to meet you! Yeah. I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I'm back.  Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way!  You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you... Hey guys!  Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD! Good morning, Pam. Drew.  I'm Drew now. Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs] Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back.  And I've got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies. Mornin' Jim. Good.  Drew. Dr--- You can call me Drew. Cool.  I can't control what you do.  I can only control what Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man? You guys... It's on! Thank you. Anything. You mean a moon bounce. I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash. Do you, do you want a drawbridge? Whoa!  What's the situation? Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end? When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods. Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys. Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind. Ahhh... Is that the last of it? It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have. Is it fresh? [winks] Umm... [draws back arm] No. [laughs] People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice. [Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing. Yes bosses. [Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening. Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump. Up to you. If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky. Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it! [in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head] [English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do. Beer me! Hand me that water.  I always say 'Beer me.'  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how's what's-her-name? Who, Karen?  Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How's the apartment hangin'? Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet. Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa-- Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc. So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay? Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation. Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here? No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef. The one in the green hoodie. I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something? She's like, probably a tutor. She probably a t-- Sh--- Jamie! What are you doing here? Are you a student here? You never told me you were in high-school! OH MY GOD! I had no idea. Huh... We didn't do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends. Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker. But who [scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words--- That's not what I had in mind. I don't care. Yeah. You know what--- I don't--- [Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! Sweet. Oh, my God! I had no idea. How could I not have realized? Yeah, she does, doesn't she? She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman. Chicken pot pie. That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation. She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to. I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods. No, we were really making out in the woods. I gotta go talk to her. Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken. Who's this guy? You're such a liar. Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes. Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me. What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need... ...your help. I love her. Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach? Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets. Jamie, can I talk to you for a second? What? What happened? What can I do to help? I'll check the web. If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models. I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today. This guy looks like a real deviant. Aye, aye, Cap'n. Think we'll find him? [pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies? Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot. Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera. Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'? Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you. Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust. I should make you my vichyssoise. Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school. You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous. We will be team U.S.A. Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers] Don't worry. You're not... No where near the big rock. What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified. I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone] [begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs] [slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast] One came up. I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words. Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad. Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle] [Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody! Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously! Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it! Angela! [lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello? Nice! It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall. Keep eating tuna, Big Tuna. Loser! [in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car] Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut. What is it, Big Haircut? Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut. What? [signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view. Saving the best for first! White, because it contains all other colors. You make a chair, but you don't sit on it. The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell. Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say? I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous. Damn it! Hail to the chief! My first order of business: accept. Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug] That's it! Class is canceled, everybody out! I'm punishing them. It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall. This is gonna look so awesome! [laughs] Totally! When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi... It is the source of all energy on this planet. I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet. Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon. Eli Edison. Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere. Re-suture.  Sutures, yes. 17 B.C. Did you see who did it? Isn't that your money? [in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple] Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry] I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin] Oh God! My nipples, it's starting. [runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin. Ay-o! Then... what are you saying? So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature... Tuna! Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office? Fire guy [makes flames with his hands] Here for what? We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together? Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles. I'll go with you Stanley. What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever. Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna. Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do. Later man. Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna. He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes. So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons. Dah!  Come on! And this is where I will record your sales. And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done. I can't tell if he's mocking me. Ehh, can't do that.  Really hard for me to let things go. Thank you. Yes like a chime or a bell... Yes! Twenty seconds to go time. [blowing air horn] Yeah! Website check please. Three-oh-five.  You my friend are winning handsomely. You my friend are in a very close second. Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady? No !  [blows air horn and dances] Four!  Three!  Two!  One! Woo! After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams. Fifty-two reams! Dwight has defeated the computer. He beat the computer. What do you think of Angela? No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N. You hadn't noticed she's a woman? I hear she's single and ready to mingle.  I'm thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right? Isn't that part of the fun? She works here too, how is that any different? [raised eyebrows] Okay. Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you're not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an 'are you kidding me?' look] Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box. Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying? Hello. They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates. Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice. Yes I will. Excuse me. I stole it! You said your upper back itched. Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you. So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested. But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down. [answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on. [Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line.  Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me. I don't know yet, I have to call you back. I'll call you back. [to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame. No.  I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here's the kicker.  That school?  Cornell. No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word. So. Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body. Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves. I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times. Yeah. Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain. Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses. Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall. Yeah. I left a little present for Angela.  I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game. Gentlemen, a word.  Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office. And as such, I come to you... I am dying of lovesickness and horny-sickness. I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day? No can do.  I am itching all over with Angela-pox. Hey, fellas!  And... lady. That's not why I came over.  I mean it's a week late, but... I just came over to say hi. Angela, you like lacrosse? Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped. Yeah. You wanna go? Because we could get some food... Afterwards at the... Still waiting on that check. Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the 'Kit Kat theme song'] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing? What? No, why? [singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce. Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car. Football cream. Grr! Hoo hoo hoo-hoo! It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged! I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base? We'll use code names. That's not different enough. Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-? Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice? News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later. [singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar. Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon. Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night. No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.' Yeah. D for Andy. Oh D. Oh D! [singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with 'piece.' Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it. [joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit. Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam. The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, it's where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety. Fine.  I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book.  Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading. Why can't I be in the club? So, Stanley, are you really outta here? I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch. Oh-oh, come on! And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have.  Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum. Mmmhmm. [leaves] [opens envelope Toby has handed him] Dear Andrew Bernard, after carefully examining your application to The Finer Things Club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time.  We would, however, like to place you on a list in case an opportunity arises when your inclusion can be tolerated.  Your position as an ongoing financial patron, however, is yours to cherish.  Sincerely, The Finer Things Club. [pauses to consider]  Yeees!  [to Phyllis] I got waitlisted. I got into Cornell off the Wait List.  A lot of people were like, 'Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building.'  No.  Okay.  I got into Cornell because I'm smart.  I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things. Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk] Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale. Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale. Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up. Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk] Pizza rolls. Mushroom caps. I played a lot of pong growing up.  I spent a lot of time on cruise ships.  I'm also a monster snorkler. Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation. Do you know anything about physics? Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they? Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket] I don't know! No, okay, just... serve! Hey-o! Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers] Except for one flower, which is for... my flower. [playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump. Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital. Yes! Yes. Michael, you're up. Time! Thought about it, I'm in. Yeah it does. I believe it means mouth pleaser. It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.' Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mmm. [takes one and eats it] I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar. I left my cell phone in my car. Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot. It's like a ten minute walk. Yes. OK. ...So help us out. We won't let you down. Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement. Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone. Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen. [at same time as Kevin] I did it. Yeah, there it is. You're welcome. Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park. Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying. Yes, it's Eddie. By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands] Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith's face] Here it is, you should draw a picture... Cause that says, that says... So much more than words... [playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective... Good one. Okay, you ready? [reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?' What about a cat eating man food? What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep? You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker. That's a racing stripe. Mmm, I doubt that very much. How next to? I have to pick one of those? Can you go over those options again? Well I have the, the blue book value... Can I think about it? Let me think about it-- Let me think about it-- I'm thinking about it-- Thinking-- Yeah. All right! What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit. I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me. Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am... totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95. Oop, got some blisties. Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful. [gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this. People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my 'knot' on. [swings] Dammit! [Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna! All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart] Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over]  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap! [trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.] Count me in! All right! Right on. [tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh! [on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard] Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring] Into the mic, sweetie. She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply] I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right. Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I'm engaged! Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it. It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now I've heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission.  And that reliable source is you. Um, I do, 'cause I just told you. But I don't think it's a disaster.  I think it's fun, and I like the food. Is that what that is? You know what, I didn't try those. [reaches for one] I could try this.  Augh!  Fried Twinkies, you kidding me?  Starting to wonder about the food in this place [takes a bite].  Oh, God!  That is so good. I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked. I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today. Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday. Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay-- Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper. Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding. This is where my parents decided not to get divorced. OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out] Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales:  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C. I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things. Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call. Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together. [Angela kisses him] Hey-oh! Why not, dawg? Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking? NO!  I want names! This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life.  I haven't had a very hard life. Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge. Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair. Your wish is my command. Of course! Yeah!  I mean it's a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know? And you know what?  The guys already know it so it's easy breezy. I didn't tell you. Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em. And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out. Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for. Mm-wah! [Angela walks away, Dwight follows] Wet Tuna! Yeah, totally.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you. Cause it's kind of bothering all of us, 'cause it's really hot, you know, it's hot, so we can lose weight, so we don't screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I'll turn it down. A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here? Hey-oh! I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom! Yeah, I took intro to philosophy, No that's... not how it works. Yo. No, I did not.  Was that any good? Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica? Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool. Really?  That doesn't sound right. No way, lady. Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again? Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  What's going on here? Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby? Well - Why would that make me a pervert, I - That's not you. That's mean, come on, that's - [Angela storms out] So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth. OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook! Look up here! What? Sorry. We're taking a picture. She's nature's bounty. That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date. J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money. You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind. Yeah? [cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home! 250 I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one. [dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Cool. [buzzer noise] We were looking for 'kitten.' Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy. Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them. Come on, you think you can get into Cornell? Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me. I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red. Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling] Take. That down. I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you. It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League! Fine. Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!! [outside men's room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out] Dwight! Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview. Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in? Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer. The conference room! Who are your role models? If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance. So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great. Let's see how well you know your Big Red history. Who was Cornell's eighth president? Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par. What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention? Nobody wants ...that, to happen. Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.' Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.' Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.' I have everything I need- [talking over each other] And you will be hearing from - which I will not be a part of- And YOU will not be pleased with the result! And your affiliation with Cornell - Will end completely! [Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet? What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state. Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you? I don't care, so it doesn't matter. You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in. I don't care either way, so....shut up. [in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye. Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly. [punches button] Speakerphone! Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet? I got mine. They were really good. Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug. Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one. [smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back. It has my face on it. Dude, that is my face! [on phone] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work. I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him! [on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous. So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful. Hobos live in trains. Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now. Done and done-er. Do you have a specific place in mind? On it! [at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes! I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms. We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers. Oh. Hmm. That's very generous. Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand] Um, what are we talking price wise? Can't argue with that. Dwight ... [takes Angela's hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other] Oh, man! [hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don't leave me hangin'! [they do] I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit! Monsieur. I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles] I will try. Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid. Ah... sweet! Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp! Mmmhmmm... Mmmm... That's really good. [offers mimosa to Oscar] Oh... Oh boy. [follows Oscar back to coach] [loudly] Harry and the Henderson's Very cool. We are going to find out where the action is, my friend. Where's the concierge? Mmm... bingo! [indicates towards concierge desk] Follow moi, bro-sieur. [to concierge] What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view? One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight? [nodding towards Michael] The Huntsman. Engaging wings [imitates mechanical sound] Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand. For Madame et monsieur. [hands Michael and Marie a glass of wine] You're welcome. Let me get a picture of you guys. Alright, I've scoped out the joint.  Those two dudes are as good as naked. Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass. I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse. You'll thank me when they spank thee. Do you guys like apples? Do you like apples? Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly] No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right. Gentleman. [walks away] Dude, you struck out.  They're totally stuck up.  Here... drink up. Anything.  You can ask me anything. I'm your wingman. Right-o. What? What do I see in Angela? I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her. No. Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for. What is wrong with her? I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her? Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh... What is wrong with you? That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question. This is Andy Bernard! I wanna take you to sex school. Is somebody there? I have needs. Naked. We'll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked. Oscar That was fun last night. You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada. You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs] Totally. [continues laughing] What--- Who? We called Angela? That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God! Oh, God! So bad! Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar] She's taking us back to first base. I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend. Wingman for life. W.M.F.L You up for a chest bump? Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it. I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he's delightful! [laughs] So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place? Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle. Kaaw! Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets. That is just obnoxious. No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess. Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms... I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.' Walk until you hear the beehive.' Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan? We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit. Hmm... mm, what's that smell? Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before? See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh. Okay. Okay, guys! What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?! Hey-o! [whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling] I'm Andy. What? Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow! Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What- Was that hot or what? [sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs] [sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all. Sorry. When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz. What's up? Sure. All right, everybody's still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs] Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. [entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday. Hmm? No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you. [on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself... When what? [clears throat] When what? What can't go on? Seems like... You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying. Yeah. Will do, boss-man. You're not making any sense. All righty. Have a good meeting! [through the car window] Kick Wallace's ass! I can't hear you through the glass What? Are you serious? [enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you. I need to talk to you in private. Let's go to the conference room. Is it true? That you're sleeping with Dwight. Is it true? Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight? How long has it been going on? Who else knows about it? Who else? Oh God. Come on! So like, missionary... Do you love him? Why should I believe that? Who says that? Where's Dwight? No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time. [Dwight enters] Dwight. It's over. No. It's over between you two. You have to. [forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me. Angela Bernard. It will be her name. And you will have to call her that! I'm telling you to back down. Then I'll make you. Through the use of force. I will fight you. Fine! Guess what? Not happening at work. We're gonna do it outside. None of your business. My bare hands. Then I'll get something too. I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot. [softly] What a coincidence. Yeah. You give up? I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance! Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton? Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this! What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods... I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice? What! I'm her fiance. [enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one. Thank you. [hangs up] What are you guys talking about? Who is the gal in question? Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive. Okay, TMI. Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand] Whoa, fire! It-- it's warm. Aah! This ones hot too! Get out of the way! Move it! The fire's shooting at us! Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram! Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine] You're choking him! [in a British accent] A throne for your highness. Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do! Da, da, da, da, da, da, da Stanley. Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges. Hmm? Who? Sam? Hmm. Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head. I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite. Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast? You guys, they're making out. [singing and playing the guitar] What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott. [through tears] Sam! Sam! I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad. Um Phyllis, who's that? For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women. This conversation is over. I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win. [looking into Julia's car] Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm] Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist's 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather... Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes. Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her. We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down. Yeah. I really like her with all my heart. So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or? Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or? [stammers] Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird. Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up. Okay, it sounds risky. Wait, what? Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so... I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket? Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee. [points to self] This is the Nard-Dog. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty. Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around? Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk. Take care Julia. [as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y... We lost the account. Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this... No! No! No! [sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.' Well that's not what we agreed on. Huh? No. You're asking him to give up all of his power. You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.' That's low, Tuna. Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her. [Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that. Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh! Hey-o! Duuudes, stop. Stop doing that! Cool. I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual. Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here. For four more days. Hey Michael... Can I talk to you a minute? I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that? Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell... I hope I get to work with you someday again. Ah... busted. Yes Oh. No way!? In this climate? Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that? [from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something. The whole office feels darker, you know?  It's just a sad dark day. I know. It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone] You are murdering the Nard-dog! Hey-o! [applauding and cheering] My maid died. How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day. [laughing at something on his computer] Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession. No way! I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner. Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me! Cool! Whoa! And he just goes, 'Boom'. [kicking motion] Goal! You know your soccer, man. I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but... I'm in it to win. Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose] What do you think? Thank you! Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way] Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage] Um, nerthing? Pffft. The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man. No, that's ridiculous. Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so- That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.] What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty. Really? Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song. Better a cappella! Yeah. Name another. Better a cappella. Aw!! Way better a cappella Yeah. This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al'] Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing. Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000. Did you even hear the music I just played for you? What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there? It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down. When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance. I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things. Noishe.' That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know? And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for? [fist pound each other] Totally. Hey, Jim. Bro, I do that all the time. Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok? Well, so what?  Your body's a ten. Jim. [hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay. Okay, Tuna. Hello. Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now. Oh, really? Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here? Uh, that's not what was- Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours. Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you. Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage. Yes! Hey, bud. Who? Are you sure? Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys. I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie. I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it. I call foul, sir. Andrew Bernard. What are you still doing not at your desk? All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order-- Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn. We could write a strong-worded letter.",ESFP,Se,Fi
Angela,"I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar. Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down. Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um... I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too. Hey. Sure. No. Stop... Kevin! That's inappropriate. It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him? You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic. Nothing, Kevin. What about the surprise? What? No, yeah, I think that's a good idea. What color do you guys think? I think green is kind of whoreish. Meredith's allergic to dairy, so... No, it's ah... Phyllis wanted red, I didn't. What is this? Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list. Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you. You're ahead. This is a cold pack... They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!] [Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you. Is that really necessary? I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping. Yeah, uh no. Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal. No. Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive. I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom. I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate. Email forwards. I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck. It's fake. She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator. You I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work. I'm sure. I have one, yes. I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you. Apparently. It's not an office expense. Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket. Okay! Everybody! Do not panic! Safety partners. Do not panic. Go in single file lines. Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides! Go, let's go. Alright, let's go, let's go. Come on, you're safety partners! You're safety partners! The Bible. A Purpose Driven Life. No. The DaVinci Code! I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code. My name is Angela. You can't go in yet! Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things. Yeah. Yes. You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night. Yeah. But we don't keep two sets of books. Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department... ... that has three people... ... doing the work that could be done by two. Those aren't chips and dip. Uh! I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things. And I made cookies. Same category. [watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party? Yes. Have you signed the expense reports yet? Michael, did you finish yet? This is illegal. Do you think he's signed them yet? Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl? I don't know why I write my name on things. I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie. I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny. Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved. Sometimes you talk to us real close. Well, when you have coffee breath- It's hard. I know. Hi. It's ok. No.  Are we supposed to? Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me. I'm just leaving for the day. Charity.  Bake drive. No! No, I'm not. I got sap on me. I'm a vegetarian. Guh. I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears] [Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it. Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights? We'll see. Fifty. [having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me? It sounds mean. Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry] I'll take the poster. Some people like these. What is that? There should be some .. You behaved very badly tonight. Hey, come inside and talk to me. I think you've had enough. It's alright. What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing] Hey! He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him. I, barely know him... Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot] He's out sick. I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look] This is from Hooters. Did Toby approve this? It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy. We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit. Were you? Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly. You could out-sell Michael any day. [disbelieving] Really? I've seen some of your spreadsheets. I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore. Are you married? At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God. Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it. I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day. Really? Well, I hope I do. Nothing for me? Are we out of jobs? The very best of luck to you, Dwight. [coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest. Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us. Can you put that down there? No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves. I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys. You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight]. Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine. No. Absolutely not. Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity. I'm the head accountant. I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that. One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you? No. This is a closed door meeting. You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though. Bologna? I don't eat bologna. No. No. [grabs cake] Oh. Thank you. What are--- it's... the party planning committee. Fine. Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie. [whispering] No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer. I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony. I understand. [smiles knowingly] I don't take any prescription drugs. [Gives Dwight a knowing look] No, not at all. Do you want to give Michael your urine? You're not going to get my permission on this. I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim. I didn't get mine yet. Can we go? I have a lot of work to do. Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever? I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor. That's... no... How about, I leave it up? But, it... Oh. Thanks. It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste. You already did me. Yes, that's the problem. What? You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization. We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity? Good evening, Dwight. What is this? Then roll an eight. Good luck, Dwight. [in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much. Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented. Watching some of your friends. Judges and juries! Sign. But I don't understand. It's for managers. I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there? Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M. In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here? That was for per diem, for Philadelphia. That town is full of history! Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you. D? Sign. I don't approve.  I don't. [walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen. Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs. You know she has it out for him now. Dwight, you should be running this office. It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her. Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired! I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair. Congratulations Dwight. It's really happening! We can make a difference here. You alone?  Because I thought together we could--- [shakes her head disapprovingly] Hi. I do not wanna talk about this. We really have a lot of work to do right now. A dead bird should not be in the kitchen! But... [quickly] Amen. Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off. Sales take a long time. I'm sure Dwight will protect him. He's not weird, he's just individualistic. You're a freak! Don't go. They eat monkey brains. How many gods do you have? [points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story? I find this incredibly offensive. Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it. I wish some of us still had our shoes on. I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat? I'll just have some bread. You used your hands. Dry. You look like you were having fun. I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting? What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs? I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame. I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore. No seafood. Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky? No. Yes! Oh. I do like it, actually. Thank you. Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club. You need a hair cut. His hair's flipping out on the sides. Oh, my Lord. Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting. Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. Last week. One of the Stamford people is a criminal? Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal? Hmm. Andy? Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that. Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else? Don't encourage him, Dwight. Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch. No, orange is whorish. It would never work here. No. God help you. These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave. You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door] This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer] [Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.' Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding. Two hundred dollars. No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock. Phyllis? Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis. I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside] [on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party? Did Michael give you permission to do this? [Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.] Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed. I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.] Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry. No, it's an invitation. Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room] I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good. Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some. You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie] Where's Dwight? Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table] You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack. Did you have fun at Benihana's? I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand] I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs? Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one? [into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty? [singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum.. [singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door] [singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum. When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party. This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me? I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear? What are you...? And what... No she shouldn't. [Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it. I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face. Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic. They're Sugarplum fairy wands. It's like you weren't even at the meeting. [Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party] There's no fizz in this punch. Phyllis! No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand. By the end of the day? That's impossible. Michael, there's no way we can do it in time. OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping. Did you try the petting zoo? No, I didn't. Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out. I tried. We didn't have time. What? They arrived this morning. Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin? Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk] Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those. Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee? Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun. Ok. This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot. Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello? That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens. I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash. Mmm-hmm. Well then. Have a nice day. How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business. I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world. Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had. Oscar. Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee? Yeah. No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations. Thank you. [sniffles] Never. Yeah. Oh. [hands Pam tape] No. I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me. Yes. None of them. Especially not Andy. Are you enjoying your fiesta? Welcome back. Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only. Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office. Sparkling cider is very good. [Spits champagne back into her glass] Thank you. Hi, Dwight. Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left! Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning. [on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me... Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop! Don't Meredith. Just goes to show the power of prayer. In a general sense. No thank you, Roy. Why wouldn't we come? This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other] You saw it?  Describe it please. Oh... [flustered] Well... good for Dwight. What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story. Mm-hmm. [flustered] Goodness. You're useless. Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings] Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading. Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery. Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together. This is just offensive. [walks around Andy's new car keying it] I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four. OK, it's three forty eight. Let's do it. Kelly's training us? [getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing. Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go? [on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up] [on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark. [on phone] It was an unfortunate error. ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something! Kevin, what's four plus seven? Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form. You two are apes. I'm sorry... that you're both morons. I called you morons. Mm-hm. Alright, I think I'm trained. Why am I getting all of the bad ones? I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous. What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so. Gladly. I quit. Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid. No, but some of your outfits are not appr- I didn't apologize. We're not. Don't! Fine. Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes]. Phyllis. You're a married woman. What is so funny? What a surprise. And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods. This is not work talk. Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10. Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead. Thank you, Michael. OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store. Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls. [in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up. Everyone put on sunscreen. What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane. What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them? I don't understand what you want from me. Sorry! Bye, Andy! I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through. Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.' Why? Wha? Who gave you that advice? But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk] No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome. [smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor. How can she make you get back together with her? I can't, Sprinkles is sick. She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles. I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with? There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques. [sighs] All right! Hey D. Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine. I have to visit the alchy. I wouldn't put it past her. I wrote it out. There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail. No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness. Hey. Any problems? What!? Sprinkles. Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time. Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking? [sobbing] Alright. [still sobbing] [nods] Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish. You never... you don't like them. That's why we're cursed. This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town. Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice. I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat. When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds. Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy. Did Roy ever kill one of your cats? [sighs] Shut up. Oh, really? [pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief. No. The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab. What does that mean? You did kill her!? You put her in my freezer. Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out. You! [hits Dwight] It's OK. It's nothing. How could you do that without telling me? Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized. You don't understand. Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying] They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far. Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons. [to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity. It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress. What do you want? Oh, what is that? Her name was Sprinkles. I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground. Don't rush me. I'm grieving. I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away] Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight? Yes. I would prefer a public place. See you after work. Very much. How's your meat? I heard a joke today. Yes, it was. I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body. I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could. I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant] Thank you. Is that all? Elevators. Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that? Good. [walks away] Waste of time. Waste of time.  The website's going to win. I don't care, but yes. I don't care, and you won't. I won't be watching, and I won't. Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you? I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid. It is awful.  You've made this day awful! Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party? It's supposed to say launch! I care! Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead. Is just looks bad. I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless. Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now? Goodie. Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks. Stop it! Gimme that! Give it! There's still an hour. I didn't ask you to do it for me. How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary? Hello, Pam. Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man. Let me know. Thank you. The party starts in an hour. Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting? Something made of ice? Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak? Chocolates?  Someone famous? Cool music. Confetti. Go-Go dancers? I can't do this. I can't do it. It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do. Ow! What? I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again. I have to hang these. I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour. That's why you're not in charge Meredith. How did you, um, where did you... Will you help me put it over there? Okay. Ow! What are you doing? I didn't ask you to scratch it. I'm not dating you. I have to go clean up after the party. Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet. I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go. Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms. What about my cherub figurine? No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp. Fine. [to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood. Lacrosse, the sport? Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them. Yeah. No. No. Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles] That's not happening. I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated. The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross. Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday. Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember? It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers... What? I don't like it. [Angela leaves] No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps. What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?' [calling in, unseen] I have next meeting! [Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no. What am I supposed to do with this? Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes. I don't know. Another clue, another clue. Those aren't helpful. You shouldn't joke about that. So you keep a very tidy house. I've noticed how you look at him at the office. Yes, What are you doing here? I hate beet salad. The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit. Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office? The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell. I don't think that this is--- I don't. A Catholic schoolgirl? A nun? It's ridiculous. I'm right here. We get it. Yeah, neither did I. If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now. Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice. Mmhmm. [laughing] It's a man eating cat food. Extension 128. No. Bless you. [Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you. We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby. But so far we only have two pictures of him. Michael... No. You know-no! You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them. No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating. Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack. I shredded it. Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think? [to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again. ...Okay. I said, okay. No. [sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God! I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster. Deep fried Twinkies?  It's gross! Yes. What? No. No. I don't care. Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it. No, no. I have a fiance I very much like! It doesn't matter, Michael. Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it. But he's an idiot! Oh, Holly, that is very offensive. Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No. [walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast. [Dwight slaps her butt] Hey! I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night! No. My doctor wants me to gain weight. It's not my problem. [dials phone] That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away] I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.] I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff. Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy? Really? Mmhmm. The guys? Mm-mm I don't think that... I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band. [Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes] That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy. I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it. Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.' Michael wrote down 'Astird.' It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose. That's Phyllis. Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert. Well, it does.  That's me. Yes it is. Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller. You gave birth in a tub? [with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready? Now. Come on, up here! Your hand's in it. Yeah, that's a good one. All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is? How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist? Kevin, relax. Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000. I never felt safe here. I would very much like that. Yeah. I think you have me confused with another person. I heard you. [quickly walks away] What are you doing? Not here. Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses. He's just trying to push your buttons. Great, then it doesn't matter. [reverently] He is fiercely intelligent. He's just.... Why are you doing this to Andy? [looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy. [sighs] Yes, that's true. I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long. OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over. No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable. Pay him whatever he wants. Be good. Meaning what? [on phone] Hello? Hello? What? Are you drunk? I know who this is! What? Are you drunk? We will discuss this later. What? Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue? Hmm, I liked it. I think Andy makes an excellent point. But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom. Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench. Manure. Get rid of it. Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day? Honey, say something! No. I haven't thought of it. I would like cat. I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat. Yes it does! I want a butter sculpture of a cat! It's beautiful. [to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and- I work with Dwight. I do. Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy. What do you mean? Dwight! That doesn't count! No, it doesn't! I didn't- We are not married. Take this thing. [takes off twine ring] [kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue. It's the nativity scene. I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer. But-- Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France. I don't-- Please stop making me do these things. But it's the season of mercy. I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on] It's outside. Shut up. I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree. I think I'd like to go home now. Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top. That's enough. What is it? That is a terrible idea. One of your worst. You're expanding on your worst idea. I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it? [sighs] We can talk right here. What have you heard? That doesn't sound like me. Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake... A little bit. I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again. Michael. [quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them] Standard, you know? Nothing fancy. I said nothing fancy. I love you. Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together. Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong. [thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel. [watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me. I'm not voting. Oh my God. Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker. Did you bring your jerky in again? [pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh. Oscar. Oscar! Pull me up! I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh! What is that?  What is that? Michael! Michael. Oh my God! Dwight! What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing? Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own] Dwight! If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter] I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin] If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be... [enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good. I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive. Seven thousand dollars. I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay. He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady! Mm-hmm. I have something better than a picture. Come on. Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year. Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone. And person. [gasps] No! Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed. No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh! [cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now. [meows like a cat, then hisses] [shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time? [sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth] As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars! Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but... My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me. No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David. I guess I have.  Huh. Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . . That is so unnecessary! Thanks again, Charles. No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David] It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner. [Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles! No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot] [out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok? Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent? [Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no! I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier. Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim. Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye. These are for employees only. You're bad at this too! Charles, where were you born? Sounds fun. Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not. What do you hear? Okay. People are dressed inappropriately. The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat. Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!",ISTJ,Si,Te
Darryl,"It's not my real name. Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers. We're loading at one. No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time. All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock. Just getting a tea bag. Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's. No, that's not as much fun. You know what? You're on. [scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. You have one more free throw shoot. Come on. Block, block, block! Take your shot man! That was you. Yeah, this isn't happening. Yeah. Iverson. Yeah, always man. It's very important. Hey let's go to Poor Richard's. Like a joke? A knock-knock joke? Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us? Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with. [fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad. Hiding from his momma. Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is... Yes, this is the one. You remember? Yes! Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl! Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen Santa. Who cares? Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done. I had to. I needed defense. It's defense. It is worth it. Are you kidding? You wait. That's okay, Mike. All right. Thanks, man. Yeah. How about the sales department is the sails? What? That's what I'm talking about! [speaking Spanish] Por favor, tequila seoor. What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right. [walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing? That was definitely not dancing. Paper business. Hell yeah, yeah, yeah. Mo'fo, mo'fo. Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink. My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time. Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today. The experience... It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this. Mike. Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now. Look, would ya... look. We're the ones that got to clean that up! My priority is safety. So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin. Uh uh uh. Don't shush me. That bothers me too. I hate that too. No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what? You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently. We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder But we get paid a lot less. You know this would not happen if we had a union. That's what we need. Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally. It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union? Man, hook you up. Union! Union, yeah. Are you with us Mike? Welcome to the warehouse. This is not a good idea right here. Hey Michael. This ain't over. That's my office. Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up. You must be pretty strong, huh? You think you could beat me up? Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see. Man, you have got to be kidding me. Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse. Except my warehouse. We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen. What? Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood? [sighs] Dinkin' flicka. I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say. Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too. Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that? What? Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year. Hey Mike. Look, I heard about the office. Tough break. I wasn't. Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good. Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers] Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party. All right. Se you later... All right, what's up Mike? Yup. Uh huh. Yup. Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken] Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life. You ready for me? Cool. Okay. Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now. Are you wearin' lady clothes? Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants. That there's a woman's suit. I'ma call Roy, man. This is gonna make him feel better. This is too good. Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton. Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails. Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise. What?  I can't hear you. I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you--- Why can't I just... tell you? There you go. I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want. Come on, be for real Mike. [laughs] Are you serious?  You're earning this? Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs] Ho-ho! Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs] [on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up] What? That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss. Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son. Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship. Yeah, you should. Fourteen years long. Make it happen, cap'in. Comfortable, Mike? How about you, man.  Comfortable? Thank you. I haven't been to New York in a long time. Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there. Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place. Mm, it's not that big. Busses, though.  They get you home quick. Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you. Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself. Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers Should you drive the forklift? No! No no no no no!  I said It's not safe, you don't have a license. Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay? Do you understand that? We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled... And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers. The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat. How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler? Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody? Anybody? Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them? [in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful... These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler! No do not touch it! There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay? Take them at the same time. Thank God we only had a baler to deal with. Actually, you did. Alright, we outta here. That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it. Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself. Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for. A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right? Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave. Way Come down, okay? Summing up. You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right? Presbyterian. Oh? Alright! [high fives Pam] [feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut. Look how happy he is. What's up man? Make a delivery. Kelly ordered this online. Who knows? Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man. Who's it? Here you go. So you still missing Ryan? Mmmmm. There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this. Hey, get off. I have plans later. I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web. My daughter. That was cold. Hey, let's call this what it is. It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door. Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course. Slow down, think it over. [singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. What's rap? Great. [singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin. You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away] You just said you hated it. [playing ping-pong] Game, son! 19, serving 4. [serves and scores] Yes. Mike. I'm very busy here, man. Why? No, no, no... No, um... I have. Both. Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors... Newsies. Oh my goodness. Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers. That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them. Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone. Well, it's effective. Hey, are we doing this thing? [in a dress shirt and tie] Like what? Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way. What college did you go to Mike? Show them what you brought, Mike. Yeah, the booth is lame without it. Yeah. [music starts] Unh! Damn it! No. Don't go breaking my scale. 2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control. All right, got it. 2,210 pounds. OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds. 2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back. Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound. Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds. You guys lost four pounds. I say we have a parade. Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys. Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS? She's six. Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right. What's up, Mike? You a baby daddy? Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby. You should stop calling yourself 'baby daddy.' Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby. You feel connected to his baby over there? You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace] You want to hold me, to see how you feel? No. Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People. Hey Mike, do my thing. Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest. Sold! To Jim. She thought I was McNabb. [laughing] Yeah, well, watcha gonna do? What's up, Roy? Oh, what's up, Roy? Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio. Mike you'll drive this every weekend? This trip was longer than I thought. Not really. Four hours. Almost halfway there. Next exit isn't for five miles. There's nothing out here man. WHAT!? Clever, Mike. [leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit. Please call me back. Please... [Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp. This is the last of it. You're not staying? But you want me to put it back in the truck. I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt. Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues. [bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na... Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that? That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay? Da  na na na na. Da  na na na na. No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na. Da  na na na na. Da  na na na na!! Da  na na na na . Yeah!  Da  na na na na. YEAH! Da  na na na na. [talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day. [driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way. It's like Driving Miss Daisy, you know? You gotta include me in the conversation. If you don't mind. I got a game. Cow surfing. Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it. Everybody got a government cow. Here we go. Go get him, Mike! Then why did you say 'Jackson Five?' All right, I made it up. Because I wanted you to like me. [trying not to laugh] Okay. [makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera] [rubs face in exasperation] [setting stopwatch] Go. [looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet. Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping. You know. There you go. Oh, thanks. Thanks. No. Thank you. Thank you. No. Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something? Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states? [holding camera] Here we go. Stairs. Oh, man.... I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay. Yo. Thanks man. All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400. You can owe me. I know, right.  Merry Christmas. Something wrong with the doll? Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right? Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there. What's his name? Roy left years ago. What's his name? What's Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again] Start over. Were the boxes near each other? I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.",ISTP,Ti,Se
Dwight,"[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] Whassup! Whassup. What? Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate. It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. You can't do that. Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. Downsizing? Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first. OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear? Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em? OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted. Go ahead. On his mother's grave. Pam, information is power. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand. New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos. Damn it! Jim! He put my stuff in Jell-O again. That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim. It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules. That is my stapler. OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him? It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not? Yeah. OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all. Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland. People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that. That's fine. I'm sorry it makes me nervous. I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's... I'm doing my job. Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually. Retaliation. Tit for tit. Well, it should be. I have two. White and Indian. A few of the ground rules? OK, can we steer away from gay people? I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox. I figured it would save time. Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero. A hero kills people, people that wish him harm. A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged. We all have a hero in our heart. Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me. Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan. OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick. Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate! Oh, man, am I a woman? I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec. What you doing? Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players. What's your win rate? You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over. Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action. Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action. Take six. Action. And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready. Cut. Oh, man, am I a woman? God! It's not fair. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture? Do I live near a harbor or an ocean? No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous? Am I nomadic? Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever? No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates] [Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French. [takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim! Yes. I can do it. I'm your man. OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire? OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine. [to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his. OK, I take it back, it's a workspace. Thank you. What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people. In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead. Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office. Same thing. Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior. Oh gee, then why do I have an office? Yes. And my decision in final. Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it. Sure. Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system. I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will. So I can lower it. It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune. Yeah, you said... I can handle that. OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do. OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office. Damnit! Damnit Jim! All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony. Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection. You did this, didn't you? Yes you did. I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one! The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis' Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula? I think you need to confess... ...the fact... What are you doing? Those are my keys. Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley] Let me out. Let me out or you're fired. Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk. Jim! Open the door! Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould. Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert. Dwight Schrute. Well... He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office. That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan. Yeah. Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim? Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone] Michael. Michael? I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options. I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered. You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis. I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy? OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures? Yeah, but no one here has it. I most certainly did not. Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her. [heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you. You came into my office voluntarily. Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions. You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences. Psssh, no. Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me. Unlikely. 100%. I don't think so, no. Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished? That was... unauthorized. Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it? Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh? But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously. You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam. You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't... You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession? Let it out. Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you? I know you did. Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down. You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down. I, Jim Halpert... ...confess to health care fraud. One word. Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her. Michael!? I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing? I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager? Yeah, so I don't have to worry? Bottom line. Do I need to be worried? It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work. I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt? Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out. Do you want to form, an alliance, with me? Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected... Did you get your tickets? The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep] There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone. Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products? Did you tell Pam about the alliance? Just now. Right, that's good, good, pursue this. Mmm hmm. Done. They seem awfully chummy, don't you think? Only one way to find out. What? I believe it. I could tell, from the body language. Good, let 'em. It helps our cause. Oh, they're forming an alliance Damn it. God! God... Damn it! Why us? Jackpot. Hey, you wanted to see me? I don't think she'd be missed. Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies. She had a hysterectomy. That's where they remove the uterus. It could be kind of funny. Oh my God, we have to be there. No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God. I know. I know exactly what to do. I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision. This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything. So tape it down. Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box. No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone. Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me. [box falls over] Oh. I have absolutely no idea. Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves. [With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson. Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer. Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me. Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected. No. [typing on keyboard] No. [typing on keyboard] [throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm. It was rotting. Any employee may dispose a food item... ...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo. Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory. Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point? God... Damn it! Why us? [talking over Jim] Okay. I'll stay for ten. Hey. You wanted to see me? I don't think she'd be missed. Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies. She had a hysterectomy. That's where they remove the uterus. It could be kind of funny. Mmm-hmm. Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus? If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion] From the downsizing. I'm only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance? Well played. Michael! Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team. Oh, please. I apologized for that. Michael, I... I can handle that. And that's why you have an assistant regional manager. [to camera] Same thing. It's close. So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim. Gimli. Just trying to be helpful. Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can] Yes! Can I be team captain? Can I be team manager? Assistant team manager? OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then. [taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins! What? Shirts on or off? You sure? De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap] [scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face! [scores] Yes! Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes] Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please? In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager. [to camera] Same thing. It's close. What? What look? Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not? Marching or garage? I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all. [eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm. Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious. Jim, you're the new schedule guy, huh? Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy. On one condition. You... Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out. No, you're not because I spent hours on it. Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back. Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts. [wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times. Yes! Sex. Torture. Cocks in the henhouse. So am I. Doesn't matter. The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies. Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot. Assistant to the Regional Manager. That's true. True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name. What's that? I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls. No. Like those? Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going... It's actually better this way. Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because... Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much. What? Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab? Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home? You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me? Do you love her? Hey, how's it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private? It will just take a second. Just for a minute. Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date. Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date? The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape. This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these? I knew it. Is it waterproof? Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel? Cause I could look it up real easily. My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt] I was just showing her my belt. I.... Not all the time. I think it did. Seriously? What else? It's a mini-briefcase. It's in my purse. Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew. Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse. Mine are at home in a display case above my bed. So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either. So who are we laughing at? Who? Dave Barry? What is it? Who wrote it? That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less. No, no, no, no... ...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think. No, why were you in there?! What were you doing in there? I am not. Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom. We are going to have two men's rooms. Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to... Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions... ...for people's behavior. And it's- [with a small fist pump] Yes! [clapping] Best Dundies ever. Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards. Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon! The waitress tripped on the cord. Really? We don't have any girls from HR. Yeah? Yeah! Like an AIDS test? Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy. Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush- It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt. [struggling] Ahh! I can't- Watch your step. Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion. [scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly] Michael, I need to talk to you. I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall. Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe. Michael. Michael. By any means necessary? It's the ladies' room. It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married. Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says. I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael. Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener? No, no, no. It's not what you think. I'm on official business. This is Dunder Mifflin... No. Phyllis, you're not... Phyllis, no. No. Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind. That is not true. That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy. What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you. All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll. Yeah, you know me. The Dundies! You know me. Yeah, you know me. Excuse me, Goldschlager, extra flakes. No, no. No margarita. Hot sake. Fosters in the big can. Just a chocolate shake, chocolate sprinkles. Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still. Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move. I'm sorry. Jim, don't interfere. Can you give me a second, sir. I am a Sheriff's Deputy. I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested. Pam, are you all right? How many fingers am I holding up? All right. Are you okay? I will. I will. You need to calm down. So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background] Do you want the link because then you could forward it around? Consider it? Yes! Yeah, Meredith. Yes. Hey, Toby. You said that we could come to you if we had any questions. Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like? Good. Good. And... Okay. Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot. Diversifying. Smart. And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers. You should go. Uh huh. You have your lawyer there? Can I be your representative? I think I should be there. I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code. Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work. So you're taking a personal day? Please, I'll make you proud. Yes! As your representative? Same thing. I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. What kind of shocks you got on this baby? [tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down. But then no one can see us. Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator. Which one's yours? This is smaller than your old place. Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex. Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood. Let's go check out the master bedroom. Oh. Terrible idea. No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed. Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off. Shh Shh. Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin. What kind of mortgage did you get? Ho, thirty years. Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies. Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live. Well, this is it. Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants. We'll be here waiting for you. A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people. Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs] You didn't have to... I don't even know what to say. Question. Where can I put my terrarium? It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards. Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires. Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas? Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine? Just for fun? Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance? Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early. People love beets. Everybody loves beets. Let's get this roof going. Ow. What is going on? That's my stopwatch. Silver medal. What did you do to it? I'm serious. What did you do to it? Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card. What are the specs? [talking over Michael] Nice. [talking over Michael] Yes. [talking over Michael] God, what a steal. Does it have a deck? Have you seen it? Does it have a deck? It's time. That's it. Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department. Same thing. Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years. Two charges of loitering, one noise complaint, several speeding tickets. Do you own a gun? I'd think about it. Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate. Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera? Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground. Seal it off. Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation. Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time. Kids? You don't even have a girlfriend. Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55? Just a possibility. If you fall in love with her. I smell mold. Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives. [looking into his coffee mug] What the hell? Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years. Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto. [alarm sounds] People! This is not a test! Move to the exits! Head towards the exits. Get up off your desks! No, panic is warranted! This is not at drill! Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively! This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow! This is not a test! Can you leave?! DO YOU WANT TO DIE? Do you want to die? OUT!! STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim? Move to the exits! We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you! Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose. Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW! Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he? Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off. NO! Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today. Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers. That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers... [to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a... Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island? Then I would bring an axe, no books. Fine. Physician's Desk Reference. ...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash? Is this your car, Ryan? Good shocks. Do it. Keep an existing... Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks. Self taught. You didn't even go to college. [scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh? [to Ryan] You should learn from him, right? Right? Stupid! The Crow. Why didn't I go to business school? The temp. Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore. He doesn't even know that I do that. Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted. I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway. Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins. Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time. Would that make you happy? If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy? I'm on it. [coughing] [coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing. That's exactly what I said. Were you absent? You failed? I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning! Everybody! [singing]  ... Marilyn Monroe! Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it! Answer me this, though. Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp? Really? The fire guy! The fire guy! [sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire! I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less. Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these. That is so cool. Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.' Kill or be killed. Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot. You could ask for an extension. I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop. Hey, how's it going, man? Oh, nothing much. What's up with you? Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking? You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape. I'll make you two tapes. Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later. Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck. [eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be? Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me? I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars. Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing] Jim. Definitely. Phyllis. Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela. One of the warehouse guys. Who is he saying? No, Michael. No, not me. Not Dwight. I know that's what he said. Tell him, not Dwight. Tell him to stop. Quiet, you. Make him be quiet. Stanley, could you come with me, please. As Assistant Regional Manager... Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry. He wouldn't listen to me If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself. [whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most. [on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.] This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment? I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills. And I turned it down. Out of loyalty to this company... ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially. But then you wouldn't have me here. It's in Maryland. I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway. You're supposed to be a cat? Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow. I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do. Where is my desk? This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional. I didn't lose my desk. Okay, who moved my desk? Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished! [In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times. It's by the ream? ...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%. Wash your hands, Kevin. [Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai... Dwight... Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai. No, that was my Sensei. I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei. Assistant Sensei. I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei. Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me. Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you. Ok, give that back to me. No. That is not a toy. Please? Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them. No women or children, unless provoked. Warehouse guy. Doesn't count. Because we're friends. Argggg! What belt are they? No! Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight. Ok, I'll punch you. Kiyah! Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not. I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight. [to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it. Good. Now watch, let me take you from behind. I didn't sucker punch you, Michael. In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai. Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go! No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective. Yeah. No, it's free during the day. It's fine. I've got the key. Yes, Sensei! Hiii! [kicks Michael] Yes! Eat it! Two more. No. It was my pants. No holding. No, stop it! Come on! Michael. No, Michael! I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott. Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves] I'm busy. Of course. Michael, I don't know... I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office. I'll have Pam send out a memo. Just a formality. Michael, I have so much to learn from you. Thank you, Sensei. [Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second. Okay, I just... It's a sales call. I can... Yes, sensei. Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people. No problem. Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight. No women or children. Unless provoked. Warehouse guy. Doesn't count. You just said it. You just said it. Die. You just... You said it. Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does. For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive. Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan. Ok, you guys should not be doing this. You took something that doesn't belong to you. Brought it in here- Made copies of it- Not now! Ok, what are they? Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk! Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good. If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang. Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy] Pow! Pow! Pow! Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage. Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt? D-W-I-G-H-T. Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end. Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now. [waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan? Did you do her? Jan Levinson-Gould. Did you do her? And she is your boss. A kick and a chop are two totally different things. It doesn't make any sense. [bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these. Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts. This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry. Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex. Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that. It's only twenty-five bucks. Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review. Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders. Oh, yes, we do. Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise. Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you? Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid. Uh, duh. Saturday. Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire? No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking? What should we do to prepare for Y2K? It happens occasionally. Tom? Next suggestion. You need to do something about your B.O. You need- To do something about- Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday? Next suggestion. Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan? [loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome! Michael? I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out? Great. I am ready for my performance review. Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise? That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays. I have a copy of your key. I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace. For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office. You liked it! Jan, have you ever had deer? It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise. And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'. Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise. [running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok! You know what this is? No, you don't. This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.' That's a total waste of your 'M.' Yeah. Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good. Pushing on. Does it specify which windshield? This ought to be good. Oh, no, no. It's on the Miata. What does it say? [clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this. Next suggestion. Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan? There's one more suggestion. Way to go man, Jan's really hot.' Hey, temp. Look, we're twins. Bet you I got mine for less than yours. Getting a little something that calm the nerves? For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp. You're lying. Why would Michael give you one before me? How did it go? [Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans] Mi- Sorry. Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing? You have to tell me. Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over. Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm- Or get hit by a car- Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke. So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails? Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately. Good. [Pam overhears] Nice. Does he have access to their medical records? I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory. Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight- I was wondering- Why? Like who?  Who doesn't know? Why just Michael? Is it? Oh, that's perfect! I won't. Battlestar Galatica. I can't- Tonight. Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice. Clarinet. Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea! Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock? You don't work with us. Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here. When is the guest of honor coming? He's gonna love it! Surprise! [laughs]  Everybody! Where's your tie? What's going on, Michael.  Talk to me. Oh no! Jan!?  What's goin' on? The most important one of the guys. That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know- Where you come from, and who you are. You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger. Jim, this is hardly the time. And their king bee. Master bee. Queen bee. Go. Get the door. Go. Push! Push! Really shove it. Shove it through! Break it! I got a splinter. I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up. One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.] You guys should use a hand truck. No. Michael, I would like to be the elf. [now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael. Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons. I want to do it. Hey, I could get some flares from my car. First present, Oscar. Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim. Pam. All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present] Michael. We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions. Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift. Angela, you're up. Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go. It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else. You and me, Michael. Yes! I never said it was better than an iPod. Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand. [shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam! Pam, steal something or pick the final gift. Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias. Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas. No trades. A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane. No. I want it. I'm going to use it. True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates] This is so awesome. Thank you. Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing? You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that. Yes. Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good. Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party? Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list. Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume. Really? Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions. Absolutely... not. What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way. I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink. Hello. Jim? This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here? Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy. Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is. No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup. Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me. Okay, fine. Where's my wallet? But I don't have any... [putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five... Good morning, Michael. Aye aye, Captain. Cool. Limbo, whoo! Me! Me, me, me. I'm stronger. I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats. [singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning? I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?! Wow. You should be the motivational speaker. Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour. Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon. Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore. Oh, oh, can I be the first mate? On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back. Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake? You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard... If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me. Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution? [silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on? I'm coming Michael! I'm gonna save you! Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there! Your foot? [holding mini-fan]  It slipped. Sorry. Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to. What? No, I didn't. What is wrong with Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport? Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid. Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece. Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding! Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan. These covers are totally indestructible. Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player] Oh no, it's broken. No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long. Yep. Huh. Do you like candy? Cause you're sweeter than candy. [looking up at Creed] Dad? [hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh... I want Michael to take me... Choo choo choo choo choo choo... Vietnam sounds. Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter] Want to take a rake... . Ahh! Ok, Pam, thanks. You're the best. It smells like chicken soup. I have to go to the hospital. Where we going? I'll be back, I mean... Why? Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose] [giggles] Oh, huggy hugs. Where are we going? Where are we going? I found it under the seat. I'm thirsty. No! I'm thirsty! No. You can't fire me, I don't work in this van! No. [takes a drink] [drinks] Mmmmm... My eyes! My eyes! Danger. Hi Michael! Ahhh.  Mweehaa What is that? That's what she said. I don't want to do this. Oh. Pssht. Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing. Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also. Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me? Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose? Oh God.  Oh God. Oh God. Next to me? What's up-dog? Good. How are you doing? Empty mind. Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar? That's unacceptable. Michael. Oscar is out sick. Can I do some of the talking? Ok, let him know that I'm here. And Dwight. Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D. Checks out. Ok. First impressions? Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick. Question? May I investigate? Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it? Do you [low] Oh God, here. Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy. There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful. Ok, what is going on here? Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim. Ok. So what is the secret Michael? Is that true? Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth. I can tell. I won't let you down. Who took all the black ones? So, how did Oscar sound when he called in? Sniffling how? Three. Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it? Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office. Including prep time? As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved. Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all. This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this? How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing. Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake. And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods. He totally misses, Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder. Jack Nicholas. [golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat] Oh, man, it's really back there. Yeah. I can barely... Should I clean out my desk? Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed. If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee. Queen's higher. Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts? Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face. Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar. Getting defensive? You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be. [coughing] It's still stinky. She probably scrubbed it [putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen. Okay. Yeah! [agreeing] Mm. No way! And who had your office? That guy Miles who quit to form his own company? No! I thought he was out on the road. Ah. [whispering] Michael. What? Yeah! [laughing] Should we help 'em pick up their stuff? Okay. [on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set. Jethro Tull... I need to make a sales call.  Please? [on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller? Yeah! It is so on! Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us! But you're the one who picked today. I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that. [on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So... [on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye. What? You're the one who trained me, Michael. You most certainly did not. What can I do better? I'm not good at jokes. My cousin Mose told me a joke. Okay. I will. [on the phone] Yes, Howard Gruber, please. [on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too. [on the phone] I understand. [on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I... [on the phone] Humor works in... [on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber. That's not true. [whispering] He's my best customer. But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael! What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality. Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering. It's a terrible idea. Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing. Yeah! We could do it in the warehouse. Remember on Lost when they met the Others? Okay. Let's go. Step up. Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation. No. No. Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!' Not literally. Word. Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car. Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit! Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry. There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy. And you want me to come with you. I will stay here and run things on this end. Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York? Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know... Screwed. What's this? What is this? Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose? [opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh! Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten. Oh I did. I did. Oh, I bet you will before the day is over. Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately? No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room] [same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of... (smirking) Exactly. You mean, like a ham? Ok, I get it. Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves] Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving. Okay, okay. That's enough. Come on, break this up. How do you spell 'animalian'? Yes. None of your business. I'm writing something. Forget it. I'll look it up myself. No, you know what? You do it. Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up. So tell me. Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up. They are either going to say yes... or no. Think it through. Fumble! Yaaah! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike! Ryan. Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread? Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs? Ha! I don't get it. Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right? What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...' When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'. I can't do this. Oh, okay. Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked. I'll try and think of one. When... Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice? Saleswoman has a vagina. But I'm right? Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave? Could I have a copy of one of them? Yeah! That is so great about the bonus! Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured. Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses. They are unrelated. He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing. Yes. Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates. Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. Michael, can you explain? I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone. Oh please! You're not taking any trip. You did? Yes. I am. Which is? I'll glance at it. Thank you, Angela. No, I can't... I ca... [bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight! WE ARE WARRIORS! Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour! [laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes! No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists] Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is... Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened? It was amazing. I wish you would have been there. What? Something happened? Weird. Con artist. My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh? [imitating '80s rock] And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera. Well, do you think I should describe our filing system? It is? What is? I don't follow. Oh, God! Well, that didn't go well. [whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar... Oh, why not? All right. Oh, no, I don't think this is it. Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her. No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode. [looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one. You are the future! There is no way that hurt. Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay? No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate. You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful. You can refer to me as Mister Schrute. Schrute. Mister Schrute. [quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight] [plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off! There's a photo... These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these--- [standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement... ...from the 1930's... I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls. ...Okay. We have better service than they do! Is that a real fun shooting windmill? [employees chuckle] And he Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name. Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So... And they do, your parents, love you very much. The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children. What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink] Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert? Oh, really? Uh-huh. Oh. Okay. Fine. Well done. Yes. There he is, the birthday boy! Birthday hug! That suit is amazing. Mmm. Maybe I should get one. Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities? Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the... Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof'] Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority. Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam] Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom. It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song. I probably care more than she does. Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here! Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please. There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair. So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin! Creed! Come on. Stanley! On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready? Happy birth moment, Michael. One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling] Oscar... Okay, that is F. Alright, what's the damage? [pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty. Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones. Here they come. Come and get it! Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup. Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer]. Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. Oh. I got it. [whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything. What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances? [whispering] But what if i'm hungry? Here we go. Make a wish. Yaoo yay! [claps] Pam was supposed to get 'em. Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls. Please, don't. I'll get someone to take it down. YEAH! Turn it around. Turn it around. Number one!! Let's get the party started. Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment. To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all. Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go. Thanks, girl. Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation. I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't. Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night? I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night. Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys. Don't make me do this the hard way. I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him. I can't stop this investigation. It is my job. I volunteered for this job. It is my duty... ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know. If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job. Well, you have... ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have... ...and I am very proud of being a narc. Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule. Have you ever taken any illegal drugs? Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it? Have you ever... pooped... a balloon? He sure left in a hurry. I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime. Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her] How do you know that? [grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit. No, it's marijuana. That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me. I would remember. That's not how it works. Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you. [opens eyes wide in total surprise] I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently. Where were you yesterday after work? Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine. Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours. No you can't do that. No you cannot. It has to be official, and it Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine? Angela, what about you? You're not on Good. Thank you, Michael. No, you will be tested. You will be. That is the law according to the rules. Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy. Mine was green. I'm all better. What kind of filing? That goes directly to the tester. Like in a cup? For what purpose? Then I refuse. Are you serious? But that's illegal. Not my urine. Were you forced to do drugs at this concert? I want him to have all the urine he needs. I know that. Don't you think I know that? My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out. That's great. It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation. I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today. Really? That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked . Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun? Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff. [salutes] Thank you, Michael. I need to go over some details with you. First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have? Oh, God. I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes. People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs. Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up. Go ahead. Don't lie. No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead. Oh. Oh. Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up. Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names. Make-up sex. Nice! The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high. just drink a lot of water. You have to relax your muscles around the bladder. Hey. Hey. Jerry. Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge. I got it here. No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore. Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could. Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance... Crowd control, directing traffic... I've only had to use it once. Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise? Clown paint. I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged? Oh, he's sure. Just shoot. Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago? That is not true. Redact it. Redact it! Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York? That doesn't make any sense. No. I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life. This is humongous. I am not a security threat... And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'. I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file. What box?! Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand. No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on? Him or me? Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore. Either he goes, or I go. You choose! One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out] I am not bluffing! Okay? Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years. I deserve this. You know I do! You have till five. Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! It's a good market. Higher volume. I have a girlfriend... So, you going to transfer Jim or not? I want an answer by tomorrow. Fine. Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go. [elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here? Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning? A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank. Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus. Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing] This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not. No, there's no blood. Possibly. [exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20? He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair. I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken. Let me see your ID. I gave her a higher clearance than you. I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally] I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down. Yes, sir. Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God! I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years. I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom. Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance. Oh, really? Mmm-hmm. How would you do that? [laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious? I don't believe you. Continue. [scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead. Oh, my God. Yes! Wait, canine AIDS? Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease. When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection. Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson. I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.' I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs. Hey, hey. Jan's here. Give me the dice. Let's go. Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins. Thank you, Angela. Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling] Give me the dice! Come on, shooter! Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson? Super 8? Motel 6? Best Western? Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael? Nice, very nice. Oh, man! Do you need anything? Should I get water or donuts? Come on, let's go. Take a seat. Office Depot! The planet Caprica. It's from Battlestar Galactica. Yeah, get them, Creed! My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm. I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though. [sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious] Of course. Absolutely not. Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so... You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive. I really don't think so. [creepy smile] Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online. Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot. Definitely. Damn.  [thinks]  I'll try Brookstone. Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons. Ah damn pop-ups. I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them. What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine! Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend. [reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice! Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no. Don't be mad, it is a business trip. Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager. Yes, Monkey. And your veil. Um. I got it. I got it. Um. Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back? Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet? Shut up. That's impossible. Well, I did it too. So what kind of commissions you get up there? You're so immature! Hey, Jan. This party is going to be awesome. Check it out. Wow. I'll do a shot, Michael. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin. I'm a huge fan. Why do they call him The Bus? Smile! You don't have email on your phone. No one just called you. Yes. Anything. I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat. So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera. He wasn't volunteering today. Whoa. Michael. Was that your per diem? Hey, Michael. Keep the wing flaps. Come on. Nice try, Josh! Yes! Ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha. Blood, urine, or semen. Mm-hm. No! What would you have done? Been manager? You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief] So, you ever been convicted of a felony? Misdemeanor? Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater? [directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end. Why him? Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who. That's not going to happen. That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart! Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms. Michael would never let me... I could never do that! [outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily] Is this Jan? This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter. It's about Michael. [exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive. No, but we should discuss that another time. Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you. Many of your blouses are Claiborne's. Part of my job. ...noted. [walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist. I have to have an emergency crown put in. Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours. Did you get anything good? New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy? I can save the branch. If you let me run it. [excitedly] 'Ok' I can run it? Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you. The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision. [shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings. Hey. No thanks I'm stuffed. ...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's] ...so good. They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so... Oh, yeah. [long pause] Crentist. Yep. Maybe that's why he became a dentist. [reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah. I know... What? What is it? No. Gahh! I can't believe this news.  That--- wow. You said that? Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will. All right. Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it. Hey... I can't imagine this place without you. Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it. Thank you Angela. Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity! Yes. I Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women. [smiling] No thank you. No thanks. Not my style. Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate. [confused] No. What did you--- Yes. You know what? No! I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD. [Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please. [terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS! [sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year! I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying] You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do? Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay? If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do. I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost. Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent. [looks to Angela] The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode. [laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo! Awesome! Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse? Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo! Really? That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart. You're thinking of a chicken. Ed was decapitated. You said you didn't know how to say it. Hey. If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice. When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in. That is not a statue, that is a robot. And how big do you want this robot? Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us. Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us. [grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael ... [in disgust] Oh... Poor little fella. He is a goner. Yeah. Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria! You want me to flush him? [trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah! What?  No, this is about the right size. I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute. I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Yes, please. Excellent. Always. [runs off] He's not a songbird. [begins playing recorder] Let's get back to work. Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all. Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both. Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor. Ow! God! Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they? No, I said one of them is not a nickel. Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ... A man is found hanging from the ceiling... A hunter. Damn it! So you excited? Very excited? Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool. I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions? When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now. Do you know where we are, temp? I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it. And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you. Smells pretty bad, doesn't it? It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back. Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm. It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness. You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? Come on! Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight] Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. Yes. Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore. What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin? Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide? Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative? Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear? Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose. Wrestle him to the ground. Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan? Where are all the animals? Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled. You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams. Screwgun. The sales call! Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much. Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time. Good. Right. Uh huh. Exactly. Yes. They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face. Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive. [Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere. Take a good look at this boy... ...because you are never going to see him again. Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man. I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American. Get in the car. Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear] No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking. Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car. Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here. [wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing. What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better. Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile. Maybe you've got mono. Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available. Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil... I see dead people. He was dead the whole time. Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut! Does Michael talk about He does? What does he say. No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later. Hey stranger. Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile. Yes! What's the plan? Can I drive? Shotgun! Still. Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office. But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here. Christmas card list. But when I do, we'll have something to talk about. So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up? No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice. [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work. Yes? What is the meaning of this? Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents. Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business. [as himself] Whoa hey, why not? Okay. [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work... [frightened] Uh! Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids. [referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it? Gonna get it? Nothing. [puts down binoculars] Then it was an honor to have worked with you. My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher. Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me. What were your favorite moments? What about when Jan said the branch was closing? Well, it doesn't... [picks up his beeping cell phone] [on the phone] Oh my God! We did it! In your face! Oh, man. I don't ... have no idea. Psh, why is that great? What was your mile time? [scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard. Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time. Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake. I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther. Man, what is taking Toby so long? And you'll compare the times? No, my groin... ...is really tight. I can't... [starts running] Aaaaah! Nametag? Karen Filippelli. Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino. That's Andy Bernard. If I were you... ...I would fire Anthony Gardner... ...before noon... ...to consolidate power. No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner. The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person. Hannah Smoterich-Barr. Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford. Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me. What are you doing? I have a smudge on my forehead? Why are you looking at my forehead? Meet my eye line, Jim! Stop acting like an idiot! Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager. So you'll be reporting to me, then. My title has 'Manager' in it. Oh. I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them. We need to talk! Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales? Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy? Ok. Who reports to who? And then if I want... I... I... One... Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty. What? What? But check that it's covered by your health care provider! But the little cars go in the compact spot Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works. Do you have batteries? Very funny, Michael! Really funny, Michael! Do this. Come on. Ready? On three. One... two... three. Hey, hey. Easy. That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him. And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy. What! YEAH! If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise. So who will be your new Number Three? And I have to say your leadership... has brought... Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please. Xterra's not even a real word. Oh, so you drive an X-Earth? That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth. Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87. Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die. Idiot! If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world. [coughs sentence] You're the idiot! [coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange. Nash. Male, age 37... Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida. [holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search. [starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight] [clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect. It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow] Bull... [bleep] [clears throat] Sorry. I had a tickle in my throat. I can't say [clearinng throat noise]? Sometimes it hurts Michael. I am cool. I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on. I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals. Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison? Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk] Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead. I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle! Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen? Jim. What does it look like? And circle gets the square. [to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk. No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed. He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. Exactly. Thank you, Jim. Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas. It's Christmas Toby. Toby... [sighs] Please? Please? Oh Pam. Take a chill pill. [standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her. [over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well? Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short. Copy. [putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol. Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer] Why don't you just buy the whole song? Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie. Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately. As ranking number three in this office, I am order - You're number four. Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth. Ok, good OK, this is stupid. No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee. Damn it! Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair. I can't... I can't here what you're saying. [off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about? [still off screen] Carol had a mustache? [off screen] What are you guys talking about? Michael! Repeat what you said louder! It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face] Who are you calling? Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there. Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though. Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better. Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention] [with conviction] Start the party. Jim! Jim! What... What's happening? Oh... Narcolepsy. Oh my gosh, now she's up. Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers. Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey! No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party] No... way! Yeah! Oh. Walkie-talkies. Yes! [into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy? [singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed... [singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum Bye Pam. [Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away] [from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking? Tape recorder. For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts. What? I'm not. I do not have a knife! [leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar! Give me it. I am not. Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK. You can't see... You can't see my stomach. Who's the target? What's it of? Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment. OK, I accept it. [to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer? Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse. No, it's... involves the photograph. I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom. There were. A lot of them. Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he? [takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here. Yeah. I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh? Hello, you're back. While you were gone... While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up. He turned over my... I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell. Unbelievable. Come on. Come on. Try Dwight. The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking. Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms] Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work! Please, I can double your pace. Let's go. Jim, move! Okay. Two at a time! You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints. Everything is fine. You are in the clear. Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade? Yup? Yeah! You want shirts on hangers? Come on!! Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first. Leave the keys. Leave the keys! No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear. Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight] Can I use your phone? Thanks. [On Phone] One... Three... Seven... Sure. Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time. Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays. I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent. My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys. No thank you. Hey, we nailed the sale! I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow. I am not a liar. Stay out of this, you! Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company. That's what she said. It's going to be ok. That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. Well, I don't have a lot of choices. Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... . I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this. One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered. I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting. For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia. I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me. How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable. There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon. [in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over. [scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell. Need any help? Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all. I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination. Dunder-Mifflin. [scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area. Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper? [to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you. Hey. Same old. Oh my God, she told you? Accepted. [scoffs] The boss isn't funny. I don't get to wear my ties. So? I don't want to do your laundry anymore. Thank you. You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign] Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata] How do you know it's going to be a boy? [Shakes head] Ow. What if he's a murderer? Maybe that's how you die. I want to do this. Action. Alright! Uh! [Spanks himself] What? I'm on it. Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want- Leave me alone and get the male stripper. I knew you would, Nancy. No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette? Nice.  Do you have any blonde women? Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases. Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper. Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such. [Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, 'Kind of.' I do!  I want some man meat! Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it. We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it. Care for a piece of chocolate? Who is the king of Austria? Who is the king of Prussia? Who is the king of England? I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure. Are you near sighted or far sighted? GAH!!! What do you think? Okay. Sure Inbwit? Yes. [Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs] I... I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise] Hello, Angela. You look as beautiful as the Queen of England. The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair. Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people? No way. Of course I saw it. I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it. Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift. It's a miracle. Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers. Dammit, Phyllis! Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple? The bride and groom? What are their names? Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on. Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend. I can't let you in, Michael. No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders. You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure. Don't be an idiot.' Changed my life. Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing. ...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk] Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT! BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes! We have... a bat... in the office. At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership. What? What's so wierd? [sighs] This is your job, Halpert. No... no. One crisis at a time. If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ. I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog. Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance-- --to use sudden violence. Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake? Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW! Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six. Goodbye Jim. And good luck. Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen. Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head] Hold still, woman! ...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome. BAT! What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous. You want rabies? Be my guest. Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be... I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath. [trumpet sounds] It's early bird gets the worm. Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great. Thanks for inviting me along. Hello, Jan. Talk to you later, Jan. Salad. You dressed exactly like the servants. Wait. I don't think yours will fit me. That would have been really embarrassing. Crisis averted. It's from both of us. Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces. Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica? No? Then you are an idiot. What's the square footage? Does that include the garage? I'm just... It's a common question. These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around. Cool, let's start with the banisters. Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door]. Just the one window? Are those real pearls? [tests smoke detector] Good. Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair? I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak? What do you know? The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party. Don't break up you guys, you're great together. Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you? How convenient. Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer? Pam, please call security! Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray] Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded. Don't want it. Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens. No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes. I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place. Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end. When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer? No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle? What's this? Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute' Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap. Really? Mm, good stuff. Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees] No need to thank me. I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna. Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned. Ok, tell him that's not true. Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him! Damn you. Yeah! Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!? Wolves. Visual aids. A quilt.  Depression quilt? [on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops! We measured it once... Seedless? Ready? [drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds] Okay. Got it. We're not allowed to use the baler. I'm on it! I'm temporarily lifting the shun. It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me. Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle. What do you think?  You've got an hour. Shunning resumed. Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun. Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision. When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults. Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk! That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll! Yeah! [imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near! [singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof! [singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss! [singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun! [out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange! [hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun. Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die! It's gorgeous.  Let's go! No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on! Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go! [outside] Come on, hurry up you guys! [on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?! Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? Is that the last year the data was available? Don't do anything rash! I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part. you said to just... Okay, I'm on it! Attention blue collar workers! Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange! Michael!  What's wrong? Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael. Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing. Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan. Come on. Step lively. Single file everybody. Let's single... Single... OK. Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy. [sighs] No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome? Right. Argh! Ghaaa! Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please. OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here. OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him. Come on pretty boy. It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back. That's a ridiculous question. Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought--- Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?! You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year! Oh, that's funny.  MICHAEL! Cri-Man-Squa? Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!' Not! [scoffs] On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair. First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets. [Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute. And you must be uh, from the Washington Post. And 'Breaking Corporate News.' Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance. Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage? [shuts door on him] Great. Emergency dentist appointment. [snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this. May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling. I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right. It's non-transferable... Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team. I'm just saying... They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade. You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb. Cut. [walks in dressed as Jim] Pam. [scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen. Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend? I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible 'Jim faces'] Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh. Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put [whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity... ...'cause there's no comeback for that. I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew. Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself. You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down. Final touch-ups. Yeah. I don't know... [coughs] ...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps]. That is a demerit. You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law. [scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those. Three demerits and you'll receive a citation. Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior. That is correct. What's a dis... what's that? [jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move! Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free. Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on. [lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert. Look at that one. Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force. Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community? Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody. Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Yes. Did you hear that, Michael? [eating banana] Mm, less than three. You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual. Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car. Alien I wish I could menstruate. If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides. Have you finished with the sketch? Hmm, doesn't seem like the type. Hmm. [Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide. Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building. No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those. More like, 'Aye, aye, General.' [marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests. No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar] Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar] You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs] [phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute. Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy. Ugh. I'm hanging up. You have information about the sex predator? Where? [hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM! I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold. If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass. I will never be your vichyssoise. Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move. OK, where does it hurt? No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body. [reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.' The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.' Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste? Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach. I hope there will be management parables. Yes! I choose Michael! OK, temp. We will be called Gryffindor. Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim. He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that. OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that. [to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba! What are you saying? OK, I apologize for yelling at you. I am trying to bring team spirit. [at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp! It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table] You're leaving? Damn it! Sabotage. No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team. If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me. [Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa.... Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa! Gryffindor! Gryffindor! That's not why you lost. Yeah, right. [bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that? No! It's okay. I will do this Michael. [walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager! [standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB! [falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh! Aggggh, that stings! The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!' [finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts. Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this? If I guess, will you tell me? Please? Is that a sumo suit? I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors. Please tell me. I've been so good... Please. Please. I do! I do! Let's go. [Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man! You wanted to see me? But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you. [cries harder] Thank you, Michael. [sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much. [sobbing] Thank you. How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton? No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job. [squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never. No. And the sheets are made of fire. Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town. I'll have to talk to the manager. I'm the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan! Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet. Eighty thousand dollars a year. Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified. Yes you will. Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard. No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael. What did I say!? I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color? Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table? What is the capital of Maine? Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company. You're not off to a very good start, Bernard. [Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed. This interview is over. I'll let you know. [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work? Michael is gone. My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two. As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug] You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession. I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager. Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position. Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills. Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant Do you accept? Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch. Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent. Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings! Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper. Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you! Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground Trees!  And where do trees grow? Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state? Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck. Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks! We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks? What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks? Okay--- What--- No wait, what are you doing?! No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled. Zip your lid! It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs] It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here! To intimidate my subordinates. It was Andy's idea. Pam, hello. I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute] Define scorched earth policy. Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative? Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens. Who was the second man on the moon? Inventor of the cotton gin. Talk me through an appendectomy. Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound. When is the Paleolithic Age? What is a scented candle? How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back. Where? No need we can just check the security tapes. It's only Meredith. Hey... Why did you do it? Was she talkin' back? Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances? Hey monkey, what's up? Sure. Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp. So what do you need me to do? Mm-hmm. Hey monkey. Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead. Sparkles, the white one, is dead. That was the sick one, right? No. Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat. So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place. Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor. She's only a cat. Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat. No, I have not. I do not respect her, but I will go. As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical. Blink once if you want me to pull the plug. Are you a doctor, or a male nurse? Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one. Just doing my job. So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine. Mm-hmm. No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something. Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw. [Angela runs into Dwight] Oww! You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger. [sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression. Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control. Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed. Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son. Mm-hmm. On your marks, get set... You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race. How ya feeling, better? Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat. I am a farmer Angela. OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do. I... I sang her, her favorite songs. It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep. Well I'm not responsible for that! Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK. It's nothing, I'm robbing her. It's fine. What? I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how. I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good. Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela? Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy? Mmm.  [nods] My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief. What? I don't see it. I think they both could do better. To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat]. It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed. And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises] You haven't buried her yet? Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him. What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless? Got it. [Andy's hand goes up] Hello. Really? I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side. Oh, yeah. Yes! I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation. Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles? Dry. Delicious. Oh, that's funny. Are you enjoying your mineral water? Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick. No, please don't do this, monkey. Dry rot? Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items. You're welcome. Yes... [whispers] I miss you. Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends. Plus a little extra. Also, I love you. Michael, wait. Let me go. Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please. Yeah. Thank you. [in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring? Ah, that's a pain in the ass. Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot. Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times. The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry] Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you. And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us. Please, come back. Remember what we had Larry? I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable. Like Angela in accounting. Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy. You don't know? He's not coming back, it's over Michael. Accept it, why would he come back? That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it. [in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side. That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you. Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there. No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307. It can't mean that! There's a lake there! This is the lake! No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake] Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael! I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground] Fine. Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this. I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone] Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone. [speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake. Yes! Take a stand! It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket. Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry! Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch] [enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now! [leaving] We'll bill you. Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology. Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter. They fall under the category of airplanes. Correct. That's an excellent analogy. [scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps! My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals. That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website. Really?  'Cause Ryan says so? I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today. You believe a computer can beat me? Well I will prove you wrong. We'll see. Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice. Just ignore him. I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale. Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me. Got it.  Carb up. Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner. Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute. Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices. Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines. What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold. It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise. Ohhhhhh! No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone] Fine.  Good. Yeah. I do not look worried. What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts. Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did! Return it!  Return it now! Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible. I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them. Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good. Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm. I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that? Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter? Huh?! Did you see the board? Yes! Woo! Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again. No no no the first part. Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you. You didn't have to. I think she's efficient. I hadn't noticed. [impatient sigh] I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with. No.  I think you should date Kelly. Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby. I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp. We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world. What did you just call him? What did you say? I can make him talk, Michael. Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights. Hey! It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor. [smiles] [kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds! Ahh-chaa! I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him. Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat! You had to, what other choice did you have? Well, yeah. What will you do? Yeah. So, I'm paying full price? Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more. Now what? Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas. Blah. Uhh. What? Coopers has calamari. Tokyo? Yes. Okay. Nice. Woo-hoo. Yum. Later on. And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper. I started a fire with my cheese pita. I date Indian girls. Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss. I don't get that, I don't understand that. Yeah, let's go. [Dwight come into office unshaven]  What? It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime. I was born a man, Halpert. I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain. Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before. [picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein! None of your business, Jim. It is not a B and B. Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest. I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin. Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones. Where did you read that? Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see. How many in your party? We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration? One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask. You took that with you. You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there. My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats. We have three rooms, each with a different theme. American, Irrigation, and Night-Time. I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions? No. No. Jim, come on. Mose, bags! Now! Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty. Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow! [reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing. [Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare? Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose. Is everything satisfactory with your stay? Great. Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff. Pam. I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in] Stupid. No. Maybe you should.  Whatever. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. Uhh-mmm [moaning] [incoherent mumbling] No you didn't. Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling] [sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away] [takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now. No, [mumbling] I don't know. What? What... [mumbling] I was aware that you were speaking. What is the matter with... me? I'm... discombobulated. I need help. State your business! That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea. Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off. Stay out of this, you! Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here. Okay, go ahead, they're right. Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on] Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers. I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around] We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us. Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight. Dwike? Yes. Andy, I can't hear this right now. She called you D? Oh D. [whispers] Oh D. We had already applauded. He looks like your twin. I will know. I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah. Found him! Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah. Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today. Yow! He's lying. [throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha! No communication with the outside world Jim. Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot. Or real bombs. Yeah, come on, it will be so badass. Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass. I'm peeing in this empty can. Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go. Hey, you're making me spray! I think I cut my penis on the lid! Believe it. And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk. Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes. Okay, Jim. Let's move! Move, move, move, move! [from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs. I'm breathing heavily. Well... There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof? I can see the security guard's eyes. I have to do something to his eyes. The eyes are the groin of the head. My hip bone! Don't leave us! Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim! I'm losing control of my bladder. Did you say Karen? Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier. Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people. Then we will burn Utica to the ground. Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you. Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going. Woohoo! [moans] Scranton rules! [sprays Silly Spray] Pam is down for anything. Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing. [winks] I'm on it. [leaves room] Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk] I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.' Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not. No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape. I would make sure that you were dead. First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified. And they would call me the Overkill Killer. What are you doing? It would be better if you were unconscious. Do you want to do this right or not? We're here. [gets out of the car] [leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow] Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature? Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it. Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles] I'm just -- Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold. Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape. Good luck, Michael. I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity. Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch. About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs]. Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on. Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth] You wanted to see me? I'm on it. Jim, Michael's office. Now, Jim! And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage. Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument. Don't you want a sheath for that? Anything else?  Flint... Parka... Tent, rainfly, gorp... Mmmnnnnmmm... All right! What is going on here? I told you. All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J���rg Ro���kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba. Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable. Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass. Thank you Michael. Michael, what time should I be arriving? Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying] Hello. We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right? So can we come in? Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg. Angela, would you like some of my beet salad? Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times. Purely carnal and that's all you need to know. Fine. Get outta here. Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers? [puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me. You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me. I'm gonna take you home Michael. Alright. [leads Michael away] I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy. Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here. [gets up from chair] Write legibly people. OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies. I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit. [on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed. The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed. She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died. Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah. Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock] You know what you need? Closure. There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye. Come on. I'll drive. I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger. Yeah. She was stoned apparently. You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive. Yeah. Rhythm and blues... Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate. Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount. You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room. Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year. We don't take debit cards, anyway. You've got a ton of dandruff. Taste good too. Wow! Lot of calories. Hey Michael, how was your date last night? Question. Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made? I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all. Yeah! No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three. [laughs] With sex! Fire hazard. Women look like white slaves. Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character. No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit. Do you live in a regular sized house? Good. Well it's weevil season but we were prepared. They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out. You've already been several times. Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection. I'll order you some cranberry juice. [to troy] Do you have powers? [to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me. [referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other? Amazons. Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go. OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go. Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this? Oh. [dumps drink out] It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try. I do, I have to go. No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright? Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her. Wow. All right. Nice. I got sofa. I got sofa. I got floor. [to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick? It's a lullaby. I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours. OK. Good night Ryan. Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes. I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry, sir. That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi. It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times. Friends with a hobbit. Hazel.  They're hazel. Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael] Can you breathe? Hold your breath. Ready? And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can. Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them. [kicks the car] Unh! Scratch. Uh, bumper's sagging. This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing. Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey. Yes. You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now. Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one-- Five, four, three, two... Now. Now. Now. Say it. Do it. Now. Do it now. Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand. Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it? There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley... However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly. Menstrual cycles. You. Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office. All you have to do it say it. Just say it. Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it. So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself. [washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA! It's my car now. Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay. I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight. Maybe he's going to church. Or court. Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences. I will tell on you. Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom] Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day. So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich- [hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him] [tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo! Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.] You're welcome. [cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello? Hello? Hello? Jim, what are you doing? Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha- [into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute! [cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail. Woah, woah, woah, Pam! Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim. No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here! Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece. Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done. [slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!! So what do we know about her? I hate her too. Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head. Would that be such a bad thing? What? But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps] [whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin? He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain. Yeah. Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked. Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos] You did. You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face] Oh my gosh. Yes. You have it? Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car] [Mose drops cage and runs] Mose! N-nothing you need to know the details of. N-no there's not. It was playful hazing. It's not rabid. Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out. Well... it's my own fault. What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands] Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich. Really make one. Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith! The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense. Yes, I do. Troy!  What are you doing here? Where is Ryan? Welcome to our land. Can I get you a tankard of mead? Looks serious. Troy, do you know anything about this? Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles! From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more. No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers. [sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife. Michael, it's time. Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up. Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow. Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale. Family only. [forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks] Fax this for me. It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind. [exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint. Monkey. [kisses her] Let's do this thing. OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done. Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past] All right, we're set. Shotgun weddings. Obesity-caused illnesses. Michael, we have a situation. They should not be in that room. Yeah! Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin. Party's over. You are so busted! Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael] Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began. I am hardly the problem, Jim. This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills. Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I'm really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line. But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested? [sighs] Sixty - forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I'll drive. Hey, hey! And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps] Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference. No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!' Vamping. Eh, I've been sitting all day. She should thank me. [exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise. We better. Yes, you do. I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam! What are you writing about me? I'm gonna write you both up for not working. Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working. [sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray] God.  Where is Jim? What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late. Dripping on me. Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer? Classy. My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation. Oh, you wish.  Hellboy's a hero. All right! Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules. Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet] Will you be able to milk with those implants? Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her] Okay. [as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper. Done. [raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know. [trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing] Yes. What should we be working on while you guys are talking? It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male. Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him! Never! What are you doing? Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch] There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch] Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it] None of your business. [Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine. Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera] [looking pregnant] Hey Michael? Contractions are coming every ten minutes. My cervix is ripening. Michael! My water's breaking! Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do? Right. Highways or surface roads? No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt! It's about adapting to the circumstances. No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office] The pressure!  The pressure! Aaaaaaaa! Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision. [lying on Michael's desk] Hold me! Cradle my head! I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa! Numb me up. I want anesthesia! No! I don't want natural! OK! Aaaaaaaa! Do you have the Sharpie?! Do you have the Sharpie?! OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy. Ready?! Aaaaaaaa! Butter. Newborns are slippery. Who's Sarah Kayacombsen? Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby] Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's. Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt. Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator] [heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child! [throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire! [tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over! I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times] Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk. Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller.  Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is.  Oh, look, a curb.  Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home. Not so weak, huh, Mom? Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller]  Oh, no!  Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely] Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe! [whispering] You set a date? A knife. You got a better way? About what? I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know. She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine. I was talking to myself. I just don't get it. Why is she marrying Andy? That's really fattening. Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have. [Dwight groans] Ugh. Get in. I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so. Are you sure that's going to work? Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight... Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt] I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14! Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick. I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires] Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what? Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back? Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan. Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl. What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany] 300 and one penny. 350 and one penny. 400 and one penny. 500 and one penny. 700 and one penny. Eh, it's not worth it. Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich? I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat. [dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear. Good morning temp. Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis? Andy. No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying! Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine. I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy. Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug] Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong. Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage. Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this. Excuse me? Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work. What do you say? Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's? That's a conflict of interest. [thinks] Interview. What? Okay. Bring it. Dale Raymond Corson! Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook] On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers. Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested. Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.' Interviewer has suspect motives.' Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need. And you will be hearing from the - -Cornell Application Department, And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy] And your affiliation with Cornell - Will end completely! [has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go. Where did you get those? I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this. [scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet] You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever. No, but it'll make you respect him less. I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder] Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love! Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk] Sorry. What does it say? That's impossible. I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file] Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes. No, but that's sometimes part of it. Impossible to say. I can't see myself. What are you mumbling about? None of your business. Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information -- I'm being sabotaged. And I'm going to find that person and punish them. You're an idiot. No way. I didn't say anything What do you think I am saying to you?! I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser. All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring. Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything. What is your name, sir? Really, that's your real name? Yes, Michael. What? No, but I -- Oh, no. What's wrong? Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited-- OK, as I was saying, right now we are having -- OK, our prices have never been lower. ...never been lower! [shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower! He -- Please, Mr. Buttlicker -- Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker. I have to put you on with my boss. [shakes fist, whispers] Yeah! You are the master. Don't do it, Michael. Get in! Get in! [he peels off into parking space] Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us. They might be listening to us You never know. Better safe than sorry. Who stands to benefit from our downfall? Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that. I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need? Who are you talking to? She's not here, Jim. Wait, shut up. Shh. Do you hear that? Breathing. Is that you? Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away] [jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise] Hear anything interesting? [laughs] I think you know. What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you? Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself. [surprised] Ah! OK. The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved. No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively] No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut] Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators? Obviously. I knew it. Yeah. What? I was -- I was right. I was right. I knew it. I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim] Yeah! Woo-hoo! I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her. Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit. Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake. We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone] I want to be here when you fire her ass. Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I? Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding. Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album] [looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night. While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands. OK. You already said deal. What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs. [raises hand] Here. My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do. Hey, what are you laughing at? Are you laughing at me? [looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh? [looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this. [is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices] It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM!  Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year. Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative. The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce. Battlestar Galactica isn't a documentary exactly. The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think. Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa. What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster. Wait, why do you need three suitcases? Do you have your money belt? No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates] Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt] Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this. [sighs and picks up Michael's empty suitcases] [over phone] Who is that monkey? Know what? Oh, well, doesn't surprise me. Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions. What? Are there two suns? Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy. It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot. You're back. Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers] Alright. First thing in the morning then. Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie. To socialize.  And inform. He looks great. Well rested. Also, it's icky back there. Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment. I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors. Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie] [removes glasses] I am the bait. Men find me desirable. Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt. Mmhmm. Men find me desirable. Those are fighting words. I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you. Hmmm? Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah! Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken. Ryan.  Come on, man? Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face. Are you really not going to punch him? I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired. [goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs. Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal. Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage. [on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon. Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears] Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator. Search his things. They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission. Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson. No! Michael, no! So wait a minute, there's no drugs? Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on! Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him? [following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them? What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier. Yeah, do tell. Mmhmm. How could it be more clear? Okay. We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine. Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on. This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such. You're gonna need to be more specific. Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse. You wanna eat, don't you? ...I'll consider it. There's a hose out back. Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture? Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard. Cats don't make butter. It doesn't make any sense. Cow, goat or sheep. Here's another place. So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here. He doesn't understand a word you're saying. Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply... And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife. I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything. Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness. Yes, of course it does. It does in the state of Pennsylvania. Haha, Mrs. Schrute. Wha... My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years! What is this? You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours? Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes. Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor] These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil. Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod] I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse? They are now. All right. Oh, so glad I could help. Merry Christmas. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching. We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith] Aye. No, I like Meredith. Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching. I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick. There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick. Oh, as fire marshal I would have to. She is a hazard to the other people of the office. I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area. Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks. Really? $200.00 Oh, that's my last one. Not my problem. Well don't look so surprised. [yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah! Yes! I was just jogging. Wait, what?  You can't take what? No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you. [coolly] Seems like you already know where. [whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me. I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything. [grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon. Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound] [moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention] You've got to tell Andy about us. Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore. Do you love me or not? Because you're engaged to Andy. Not yet. Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready. I don't know. [boastfully] Yes. Eager. And flexible. Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down. Might get ugly. [to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip. If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin. If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to. Andy. Oh good. She broke up with you. Uh, no way. I am not giving up. No I don't. [angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me. Will never be her name. I don't think so. And I'm telling you that I will never back down. Oh really? How are you gonna do that? That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest. Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela. Fine! What is your weapon? Hey, this is none of your business. Yes! Outside of work. None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon? That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands. I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location. Mm. [innocently] How'd that get there? [shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out! Come on! Where are you? Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly] [still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation... Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey! Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah! Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man! You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her! Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain] No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit. Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain] I sa- [Andy honks his horn] Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch! What? She's sleeping with you? She said she was only sleeping with me. [picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can] [as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over] What's this? Hmm. It wasn't here before. Yours doesn't. No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires. [riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets? No, I wanna seduce her. Please Michael, please. You'll fall in love with her. Okay, let's go over the plan again. Your fictitious name? I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries. Then we meet at the Denny's... ...and then we compare notes. No! [arguing over each other] You know how I feel about IHOP. Are you socialist? I'll have a cup of a coffee. Store only has three employees. It means they are not expanding. No. No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved. [spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch. Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth. Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus. Get your clouds right. So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good. Yeah. Hello, I would like to apply for a job. Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son] I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients? Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business. Me too. [smirking] My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over] It's going very well. [both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door] Cmon. All their top clients I can't believe it. Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching] You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching] That's not good. Oh my God. Oh man, Not good. Yeah. You've done more then you can possibly know. He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the.. How much longer is this going to take? This is disgusting, what is it this, instant? I look forward to hearing from you about that job application. Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye. [punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently] Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them. They could do better. What? I'm not familiar with that expression, It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive. Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel? Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us. There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died. Yeah. Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going? Where are you taking the client list? Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot] Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot] No no no, I can't let you do this! Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael] Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up] Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy? Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid] [looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky? [clears throat] Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people? Oh, how did that happen? No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct. What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure? Wait, wait, wait. No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway. Not a viable option. Okay, what's next? Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle? Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once] Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching! Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can... Okay, let's go. Calm, please Have you ever seen a burn victim? Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth? A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people. What's next? How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.] Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making. [blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation. Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack. A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time. Shampoo. I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days. Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded-- When no one hedded-- N-no one would take hedded of my instructions. So, you-- And, well, I don't see my co-workers-- Hee-heeding this right now. No. PETA. Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry? Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay? I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping. What? You? Come on. That's preposterous. This is a farce. I should be teaching this course. Absolutely I would not. Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose? Anyone else? Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. He is. Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go. We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart. Clarice? I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic. Wow. I have. [clears throat] 'I state my regret.' I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal. Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now! Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors. Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology] May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you. That was the last signature I needed. How dare you all attack him like this. Michael is your superior. Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him. Ok, no, they don't understand who they have... You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back. Are you calling me an idiot? Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing] It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them. Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring? Oh, that's quite a leap Pam. [after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it. Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck? Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior. Go ahead, you do it. I insist. What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face] ...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads. [at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side. If you say screw you one more time... Hey, HEY. Oh God. What kind of cake do you want imbecile. Well, I'm not done yet. They match the carpet It's a statement of fact. This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer. Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's. Have you collected the money from everyone? How much do you have? [yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim! [sighs] [struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Who is this? Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you. Uh, 24. 37. [sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around] I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...'  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file] [shouts from another room] What did you do? What did you do? What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm? Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15. In juvie. Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers! For reha- What did you do? Huh? Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do? I thought you said yesterday was your birthday! Frosting. Nice job on the cake, Bozo! Busy! Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face. You know what? I'm a little busy. It's not effeminate. It's festive. [blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too. It's in the name. You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid. Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite] Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you? That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed. Hey, it's not a surprise. Told you. Our theme, if you will. That's our theme. [high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor? No. Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go. Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this. [turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door] Mm, great cake. [opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door] [running from his desk] Ayyyy! So sexy it becomes hostile. Yeah, deal with it Pam! Having trouble finding a vein? How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm] I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat] You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work. A net? a giant net? What do you have in mind? Oh God, that's a terrible idea. No. Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt. Hey.  No movement. Eh, its not that early. I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side. Oh.  Meh. Eh. Hello. Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight. I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead. You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today. You must use a lot of paper. ...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door? Is somebody after you? Hey, it just takes one! Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up. So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you. OK, what's up? Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign-- OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God! Thanks, Michael. I got a knock-knock joke. OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me. [clears throat] Knock, knock. KGB. [in Russian accent] We will ask the questions! What are you doing? Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it! C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke. I'm not answering it. No way, it's the KGB. I'm not answering that. You answer it. I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight] It's true. That was your idea. You did. Several times. Over and over again. [same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so... Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't. You don't keep a diary. Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year. To keep secrets from my computer. Impossible. I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math. Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies. With all my heart. OK, what am I thinking right now? No... How skin is the largest organ of the body. Oh, not gonna happen. I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again. What about Shoe La La? I love working here and I do not want to leave. Well... We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world. No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom. Try me. I haven't made a decision yet. No. He said he would do the same for me. I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination. David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations] That's what she said! [David laughs] Inspiration. [same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom. Apology rejected. Oh Pam. Thanks old man. Yeah. [same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea... Alright. OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka. So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room]. Pam... That is my idea. It is my idea. It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas. Horse Boat. A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat! Oh give me a break. That's because they're easy! [same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh... Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death. Oh I am. In my own words. No. No, Michael. No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand] Ding dong. KGB. [in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there? We have more houses to visit. We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45? How about 5:15? Very well, we will come back at 5:15. Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause. Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence. Jim! Enough with the classy, ok? Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here? Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces] Mr. Peanut is not classy. He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat. Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries. Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then. I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him] Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities. We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is... What about your party? Ask him about the party. No the other thing. He hung up? Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone] Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today? How's it hanging? Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds- Excellent. Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife, [examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you? Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II. Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus. My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious. Your own paper company. Right... What a courageous venture. Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities... Okay. So yeah. You know, I would love to put a pin in that. No. Hustle! Way to go. What? This is how I breathe. If you want to tell me - Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles] Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it. Wow. You can be so modest sometimes. Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around. Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say? Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table. I don't try and be anything that I'm not. Jim, what do you say? Game on! Wing. Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment? Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together. Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do. You know there's a ghost in this office A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute. Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor. Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop. It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder? That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder] Just kidding. You finding everything okay? Yeah? Erin [eerie voice] Erin... Hey buddy. Hey buddy, what are you up to? Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis. Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us? And I, yours. So I will cede her to you. No no no. Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom. You're good. Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it. Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven... In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh Cherry Pie, Warrant. No! Really? Enter Sandman, Metallica. Rebel Yell, Billy Idol Really? These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands. Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence. Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay. When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared. Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change. They have some great kitchen ideas. It's small, I know. Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this? Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend. Michael, you know I can't take this. But don't forget you owe me $10. Michael. You needed to speak to me? I prefer to stand. Less blood clots. Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard. Your concern is noted. Like a wolf. Thank you. Really? [sighs] It's firm. I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up. No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast. Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero. Good, do you see what I'm saying? No. No. It is possible that I could be talking about us. It is the situation that we are in now. I'm not a barbarian. I will. Yes? I've said too much. I'm sorry, Michael I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it. [on phone] Dwight Schrute. I think you have the wrong number, Michael. [on phone] Mr. Schofield, please? Dammit! [hangs up] I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried. And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds] And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown. Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still... I would like to arrange a truce. Meet me in our spot in four minutes. Michael. In which direction? At what time? That- [looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry. Michael. You were making me do things that were not all right. And not come through for you? I want a truce. Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's. I had fish yesterday. Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic. I hit a bear. He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese? Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex] Did you enjoy your lunch? No, Michael, you were sabotaged. Me. I broke it. Yes. You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf! And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich! Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say. [holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.' And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here. Sure. That'd be fine. This is war and that is what happens. Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Michael! Michael! Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael! Are you saying you invented paper? It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office] Spin move. Ha ha! April 13th, 2002. I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased. La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour! Come on. What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you. Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son? How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore? [sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more. It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired. Been there, done that. David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you. Come along, afterthought. Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak. I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor. [scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs] Five minutes exactly. Sure thing. [over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way. Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something? There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom. Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure. You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this? Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles. May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke. They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures. Quiet you. You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty. I'm gonna answer Charles first. Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed. Done. I'm not-- I'm not following you. Wh-- [after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing? Wait, what? Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back? You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients. Fresh hot ink. Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully. No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words. When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine. Okay, what are you still doing at your desk? Did you even read the memo? No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto. Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing. We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone. No, you're too close. Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients? He doesn't like it. Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here? Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage. No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things. Excellent question. Words will never be enough. No, pictures are too interpretive. Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs. C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--",ESTJ,Te,Si
Holly,"Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson? I love the view. Hi. Man, someone doesn't like H.R. [to Toby] What did you do to him? Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott. Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here. What do you do here? No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle] Oh. Good for you guys. Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi. What do you do? Oh, good for you. Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though. Well that is a very safe place for them. Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually. That's good. No, no, I... Ooh, uh... Um... Y-yeah. Okay. Thanks. Great. Hey Kevin. Do you need some help? Well, what do you like to eat? Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row. [tool clicking] Damn it! Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights. Yoga. [as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will. Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding! [overdramatically] Acting! [laughs] Lovitz. [enters conference room] Hello. You too. Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here. No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job. Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look? Here you go. Oh, I'd like to hear the answer. Oh that is so sweet. What's protocol on this? Michael, are you okay? Oh, of course you are. No, hey. Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?... Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up. I think it's really cool you hired Kevin. That-That's my car. Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here. I just... Um, excuse me. Cool! You drive your own car? Yep. Just like you. Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you. Not bad. Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.' Is he okay? Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him. Hey there. So you missed something really big. Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants. So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or... Okay. Oh that would be great. I love pie. Okay. Okay. Good night. Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in. Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you. Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman. Oh, I think that makes us neighbors. Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done. Great. Ex-squeeze me. Almost, Kevin. Math is hard. And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose] Oh, thanks. I should check that out. Actually, I'm a lesbian. I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke. There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women. Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just-- I knew that. OK, bye. Oh, fancy meeting you here. Wikka wikka wikka what? You're shaking. Are you all right? Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet? Oh, she's very beautiful. So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number. No! You do not talk to him like that! He is not an idiot! He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here. Well, no. Dwight... I'm sorry. I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake? Obesity-caused illnesses. That's so lame they didn't invite us. Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight. It'll probably be a total disaster, but... Really? Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck. It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off. Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok? Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right? What's wrong? Dieting's only half of it. And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym. ...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---' What are you doing? Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so... I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off... Oh, no. No. And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call? Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds. Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters. So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all. I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy. Yeah. Yeah? Aww man, I really wanted to see them. Look at where my seats were. Yeah. Michael, you don't have to buy them. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, great.  I got it. Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time. Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder. Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired. Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree. Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement. Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing. Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters? Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about. Well, I just have to get through the binder. I am? Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right. No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing. Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace. What was the dilemma? Oh--- no no no. No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that. Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods. Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith. I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line. So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been? No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business? What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper? Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this. It's Mike-raculous. Sounds good. Oh I already bought this... So, I've gone over corporate policy. Oh, it's very nice. Mmm. In Summer. Maybe we should talk about Meredith first. Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated. I'm from da future. Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules. We punish her? I don't think we could enforce that. A chastity belt. No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened. What am I saying? I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated. It's not a family.  It's a workplace. It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over. Can I sit? Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar. Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical. Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it. No, I understand. No.  I can do it. Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar. Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training. In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible. Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place? Ahoy. Good. Of course. Yeah. You OK?  You seem kind of... I can imagine. Oh, I think she's on a sales call. Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break. She's with Angela. You still gonna be mean to me? Yes. Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful. I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby. I know. Really? Hello. Yeah, it was nice. Oh, that would be great. You need that. Yeah. Yeah. It would help. [to camera] No, he didn't. Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs] I don't care, free tonight. [gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight. I'm going out with you. [shakes head] No more. No more. Thank you, you too. Oh, the mall could be fun. We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog. ...Hell yeah. Yeah, that's good. [playing cards] It's time to go. You're crazy, go crazy. [walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys. Yeah, lets go grab them. Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom] I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us? Oh, good. Can I talk to you for a second? That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors? Michael I think this is our fault. Oh... How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk. Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss. He knows how to get things. He got me. [giggles] Sorry. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true. Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours. Michael is taking a personal day to move me up. Breaker one-nine, copy? Kidding. It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So... I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets! Yeah it did look shorter on the map- You were sleeping?  You were talking before. We're only halfway? Let's check there. No. No. No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying] It's not gonna work. There's too much distance. Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks And I like you too. I've dated four guys last year too. Oh. Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be. If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best? And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again. Oh. Well- How long could we keep that up? Years? Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend? [kisses his temple] Thank you. I do, I think so. You'll be okay You will. Okay. Bye. Well, I'll be around. It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly. [interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar] Okay. Yeah, okay. [extends hand to Kevin] [pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen. No, we're gonna do the long-distance thing. Yeah, thanks. Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses. [talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper. [chuckling] No, that's not what you're grabbing. Put....okay.... Sorry, Darryl. All right. Were there even cows where you grew up? [grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game. Darryl.... No, you. You are. You are more. You're better. You're better than betterest. [plants kisses all over Michael's face] Hold your breath! Look, Darryl, lip up. Down, and give me 50! [hugging Michael] Oh, snuggles! Snuggles. Spooning. Mmm hmm. Ooh! We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace? Mmm. Yeah. No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke! Darryl didn't want any? I know, but from seven hours away. Michael.... I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet. Oh, it's just later. [unlocking front door] This is me here.",INFP,Fi,Ne
Jan,"[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great. Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? What? I'm sorry? Well, I faxed one over to you this morning. Do you want to look at mine? OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch. Michael, don't panic. No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided. I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other. This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing. Go ahead. So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily. So, which health plan have you decided on? Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael? The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan. Michael. You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan. It's your job. So... Michael... maybe... I mean... Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time. I'm doing it right now. To you. Hello? This is Jan. Who is this? From sales? Where's Michael Scott? Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand? Really? OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately. No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again. Are you listening to me Michael? What did I just say? Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales. I'm not going to do that Michael. We've created an incentive program to increase sales. At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars. Uh, yes. Yes you can. No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize. [on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael. No. No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this. Are you there Michael? Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you? You already had a party on May 5th for no reason. And you had a luau.... And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money. Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense. [to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi. You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem? Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything. Do you need to see the video again, Michael? Michael. MICHAEL! Michael, please. Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really. That's not my sense of humor. Wha... [to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer. Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself. [on the phone] This is Jan. Excuse me? Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you... The person that you fired, Michael? Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset. Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was. Well, I'm glad you did it, Michael. And so, good job. Good job. Yeah. Good job. [talking over Michael] Yup. Yes. This is a projection of the county's needs... Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals... So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um- Excuse me? You had no right to do that, Michael. It said that. Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting. What? Thank you. Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour. Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour? So which way is Chili's? Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there. I know Scranton. Alright. If it's a couple blocks away- Ok. Why would we need a signal? What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael? You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that. Just Jan Levinson. No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long? Michael. Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me. Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please? We're in a meeting. Christian. I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county. What? So- If you have a- Christian, you don't have to listen to this. Just the one. [to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please? We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match. What's the bottom line? I don't think Christian has time for that. Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really. We'd been fighting for a while- He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine. I was stupid. Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh] Bye... thanks. [pumps fist] Yes! We got it! I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go. Let's go. I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation. And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m. What? What do you mean? Michael.  I need you to take this seriously. Michael- Are you hearing me? This is a very important- [sighs] I'll see you in ten minutes. Michael. I am returning your many calls. No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch. Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael. I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior. Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior. Michael. Are the cameras with you... ...in your office? [on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here? I'm good; how are you? Nice to see you. Can we please go in your office? Thank you. Nice to see you too, Michael. Not like that. You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business. Period. Do we understand each other. So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then? No. Fine. How is that a business question? Please don't smell me, Michael. Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now? Great.  Very good. That sounds serious, Michael. I can't, I can't- Please sit down. You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there. Please, sit yourself down. What, Michael. Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same No, Dwight; come in. Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael? That's a serious offense! Oh! Michael, for God sakes! No. Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes. [Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight. Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light? I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow. K? Michael, now is not the time or the place. No, I am saying we are never having this conversation. Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.' Michael, it has nothing- With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate. Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok? And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that- At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok? Ohhh, God. I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business. Period. Do we understand each other? Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself. The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that? Never for me always means never, ever, ever. What? What did you say, Michael? Did you call my ex? Gould, you said, Gould. How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you. Okay, how dare you do that? Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you? I mean... Hello, Michael. Can we come in? Thank you very much. Brenda. Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss? A booze cruise? What do you mean? Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations. Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible. We discussed that. Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training. I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches. Brenda. Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and... Good luck, Brenda. Okay, see you later. And try to be professional. No, that's all right. You call me if you need anything, Brenda. So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well. Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So... Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here. What are you doing? Michael. Michael. You are not allowed in this session. Now you're really not allowed in this session. I'm your boss. We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please. Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize. Yes, Pam? Michael! [in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone? I don't know what you're doing here, Michael, ... but it's very destructive. Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael? Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse. I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then? Please? Thank you. very much. Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking. Great. Phyllis? No. Okay. Stop. Go on... That is an excellent goal. Great! Uh-huh? Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life. Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream? You know the company is offering a design training program in New York. Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out. There are always a million reasons not to do something. All right. Let's talk about clothing. Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be. Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before... What? A union! What... I'm not... The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here? You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out. That's too bad. I don't want to... Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael. Don't say another word. Get yourself down stairs. Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means... Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense. Excuse me? I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know. [in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about. I'm divorced. It was. Yes. I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff. Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five. Did you take care of the situation? Excuse me. Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael. Josh Porter, Stamford. And Michael Scott, Scranton. Fine Michael. Thank you. Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous. OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig, Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant? Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken? Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch. NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired. Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together. Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand? Surely, you cannot be serious? Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it. Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice. Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day. Oh. Hello, Michael. I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent. Well, today's not my birthday, so... ...Happy birthday, Michael. Am I on camera? [on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting. [on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee. Michael? You know that I'm very serious here. What? I thought that you were their fearless leader. [laughs] I think you can handle it. I think so, Michael... Goodbye, Michael. Michael? You know, I... I thought about it and you are right. I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night. Incidentally, what is the charity? Okay, then. I will see you tonight. Bye-bye. Michael? Hi. What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about? No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss. Does anyone want a drink? Okay. [Carol stares at Michael] Cosmopolitan, please. Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been... Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport. Oh, me too. Me too. What? No, I... I didn't... I don't know... Smoke? Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here. Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed Why did I hook up with Michael? It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer? Good. Have you told anyone? Well, you should. Hey. I'm leaving. So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud. And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks. Nice to meet you. And you guys have a good time together. Yeah. You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation. That's not what it's called. Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it. NO! No, it's not possible. You know, imagine... you were gay. Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand? [on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch? [under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically. Specifically [on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael? Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished. Oh, hey! We all checked in? Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour. Okay! What are you talking about? Step away from me, Michael. Great! What have you generated, Michael? What party? Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7. Really? Well, Michael, I underestimated you. [Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together. A quick drink? [putting on a good face] Great! [walks off] [walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello? Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room] How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that? Magically? No. [answering the phone] Hello? Who is this? You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other. What about him? It's not about a surprise party is it? Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back. How do you know I like that store? How do you know that? No it's not.  It's officially not. Yeah. Really? Ok. What would you do differently? Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers. [thinks for a second] Where is it? [on speakerphone with Michael] Michael. I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees. No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you. Mm-hmm. You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately. Hey, Jim? How's work going? [kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves] [on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck. Michael, Ed died over the weekend. [on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off? Well, what would you suggest? Of Ed? [scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic. No, that's not--- What the hell are you two talking about? You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today... ...and I have to get back to work. So call me when you feel like having a real conversation. Goodbye. [hangs up] [on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend. Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know. Yes, they know, Michael. I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects. Good. Tell me what you did yesterday. Nothing? I don't care how your day was Michael. Tell me what you did yesterday. Hi, Pam. I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok? Thanks Pam. What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time. Zoning out? If you can account for your time... ...then maybe corporate can justify your salary. Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today? What is Diwali? Yes. Mich--- Oh. Oh. Yes, of course, I know Kelly. I thought she was Muslim. Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea. Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event--- ---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself. Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric--- Michael. Michael. Michael. I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch. The board voted last night to close your branch. The board's. I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service. A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages. Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person. Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael. It's... it's about talent. Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future. Hi. Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics? So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two. Awesome. Wha... excuse... why not? Today? You leveraged your new position with us into another offer? Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I... I'm gonna make some calls. So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford. And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch. Yeah. Michael. Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay. [in Scranton] Where's Michael? [looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here? Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe. Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him. Back? Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few. Michael! Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit? Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance? You do? What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two. He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this. [over phone] Mmhmm. We get that money for hiring an ex-convict. When did the check come? Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move. Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line. ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash. Michael? Hello everyone. Hello Michael. I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister. Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office. Why am I here, Michael? In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me? I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself. This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks. This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you. Good, good. Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time... Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo. Oh, God. Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister. Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and... Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.' [On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay? Okay. Uh when, when did, when last night? You went to a bachelor party at work? I'm closer to firing you. I'll talk to you later. Michael? Hi. Let's just blow this party off. Am I on speaker phone? Is anybody else in the... Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone. Ok. Let's just go to a motel... ...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica. Still on speaker? Are camera's there? See you soon. I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR. You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company. I've never told you that I love you. I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star. What's this over the 'i'? Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying? Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please. Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott? From the Scranton Branch. David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please. We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok? Martini please. You ok? It's nice. I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family. I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes. Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael] Don't you know what I'm doing? Shut up. Come on. What? Just let me loosen my dress. Michael. Slam me up against the wall, right here. Oh, please. Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out. Not too good. I feel sick. No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public. Please don't cry. It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him. I didn't mean it. I was... Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it. That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it. Ok. I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes. Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office! [sigh] Is Toby there? Ok, what... what is the situation Toby? Thank God. All right, well are you gonna take care of this? What did I tell you about 'yeppers?' I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that? Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends? Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five? Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present. Da--- Darryl from the warehouse? No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby. Michael, he's your branch's HR rep... ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it. Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay. That's my new assistant. I have to call you the second I get a new assistant? Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear? Right now we can offer you a 6% raise. Oh, God. Michael--- Michael--- Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere. Ok, Toby, how about if you... Great. What's wrong with you? Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15. No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay? No.  But we can offer you 12. Michael! [on speakerphone] Michael, ... ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body. I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser. $300? You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on? Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry. So... we're good? [cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry. One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner? OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...' Oh. [door closes] So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription? Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would? Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it? Wait, wait, what cartoons? [Sigh] Right uh, Michael. [walks through front door] Michael. Uh, how are you? I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute? I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things. Okay. Been good. Good. Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail. After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation. To kinda clear my mind. It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time. I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together. Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room] So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently. I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities. And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation... Thanks. Oh, okay. Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye. Hey you! How was your interview? Yeah? Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you. What? What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there? Tell me what? You son of a bitch! You're Erratic? [opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these? No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court! No? Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about. Yeah! Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving. [giving a hug] Bye Hunter. Good luck with your band. Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored]. Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs] [sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do? Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really! OK, name please. You're over 75 years old? There's no prize money. So I heard that you were peeping on Michael. I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off. Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe? Michael that's irrational. Hi, Pam. Is Michael in? [to Ryan] Hey. Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan. Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title. Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry. Thank you, thank you. Best decision I ever made. You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office] Hey. What? So, what's Ryan doing here? He's such a snake. I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit. Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off. Yes, Michael, they do. [sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch? [on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated. Is it really that important to you? Alright. Go by yourself. Well... What? No Michael! You do. Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too. A futon's not a sofa. I know what a futon is, Michael. It costs what it costs. We have gone through this. Conniving little runt. Put him through. So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight. Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car? You drive, I had too much wine. I didn't go. I just didn't! How was improv? [on phone] You're broke? [on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say. [on phone] Yeah, what? [on phone] Okay, where did he go? [on phone] Well, is he coming right back? [on phone] I'll be right there. Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar] Michael. What's going on? Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going? What does that mean? Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that. Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically. Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad. Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen. Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us? I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though. It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now. I just think that... Why? I think you can.  I... what? All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else. Well... well, we will. We just will. I have some ideas. [laughs] I am not going to tell you yet. Oh, yes, you will. [laughing] I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club. Good. And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior. Um, no, I want it up. My hair. Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior. Does this work for you? Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky. Four million. No, Michael. Oh, come on. Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment. Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down. All right, fine, just a second. Hold on. Michael, just relax, okay? People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater. Can we just move on to another question? Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question? Uh, yes. I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this. You keep it under my side of the mattress. Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even. I love you too. [looks at Lester] Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy. Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition. How about Chinese? That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion. Fine, fast food's fine. Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars. Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat. Hi. How are you? Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe? Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with. So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first? Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first? Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs. Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here. This is my office. Not super exciting. And this is my workspace. I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell. Uh-huh, Bonfire. Men love this one. When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away. Just like that. So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white. [puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up. Shame on you. See, he fits perfectly. It's pine. Really? I bet you are. It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.' [doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second. [Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here. Oh, how thoughtful. Aw. How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner? Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done. You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight. Do you have a preference, upstairs first? Follow me. So music, should we turn some music? Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter. Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me. Joe Camel! Oh! Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down? No. I was watching Jim. No smiling. No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes. No rhyming! [eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it? Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck! You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil. I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip. [checking the oven] Uh, not even close. You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam. Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated. Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him. Mmhmm. Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler] What are you doing here? What is he doing here? Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want. We saw Wicked. I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid. I hate my life. [crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table] [Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting. Oops. Hey babe? How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it. Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud] At least he's an artist. [shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT! FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY! YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT! AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST! [running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him? Bye Babe! A little amuse-bouche, anyone? Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means? Oh! [Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe? [coming up suddenly]  Are you eating? Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly] So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?' Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors. I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep. Yeah. Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It was me! I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it. What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt? Please, please.  Don't hurt him, okay? Well it was good to see you. Yeah, so... Hello... Michael. I... No. Uh, no. I didn't... ... touch that. Why? Yeah, it did... ... happen when... ... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad. ...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not. Yeah. I went to a sperm bank. Yuh-huh. Uh, yeah. I know. No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables. IHop. If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count. Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table. Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner... Okay. I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow. Hi. Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil? Oh, they found her? That's his ex. I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael. It's like nothing's happening. Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there. Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners. Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I... You mean breastfeed? Uh, I'm fine, thank you. Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael? Hi, Jim! This is my baby. Astrid. Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and- And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so... OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's... I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet. Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah. trid. Well... Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that. Thank you.  That's very sweet of you. Thank you. [singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one... [now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one... Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing. Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb. Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah. Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed. And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving] You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit? All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty. [wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep. Where's Astrid? On a what? [sarcastically] That's funny. What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me. [picking up Astrid] There you are. You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that? Michael, I need your help. Uh... come on. Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go. You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with? Ah.  Thanks, Dwight. OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me. Don't date Holly. Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon. OK. Well... OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so... OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it. Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK... Uh, yes, I did. Oh. Well, this is a highly exclusive establishment. Well, I paid for an ideal specimen. This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you. It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide? [Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job. You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and... Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!",ENTJ,Te,Ni
Jim,"Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So... Actually, you called me in here, but yeah. My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this. Whassup! I still love that after seven years. Nothing. All right. Take care. Yes? Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous. Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing? What are you doing? It's not on your desk. Why not? [crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me. If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry. How do you know it was me? OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan. Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink. Tonight, hopefully. What's going on? You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun. Yeah, yeah. Um... What's in the bag? No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do. Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head] Hey. How are things? Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache? Good. Good. That's great Yeah? Am I walking out? Yes, I... Do you want to... Great. Let me just... [Car horn honking] Oh, Roy. Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here. My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know. That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second. Do you really have to do that right now? Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight. That is not the expression. This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right? Solitaire? Six on seven. So then, why didn't you do it? Who doesn't love that? Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please. You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that. Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you. : Uh, is that it? Hello? Hello? What are you watching? Really? No way. I think she likes this stuff. Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but... Oh, yeah. She's hot. [on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you. [Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey. Hey. We can go. That's fine. Uh... Not a bad day. Freecell. Well, I mean. Um, what's going on here? Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down] Yes, yes. How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here... Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote] Go get 'em. Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King? I think she wasn't wearing a card. Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it? Interesting, what's that like? Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is... Gosh. That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales. Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this? Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it. Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train. It says 'workspace'. If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'? You are not my superior. I thought it was a workspace? You cut more than you had to, didn't you? Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance? OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies. OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential. Workspace. Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both. Oh, great. I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion. Thank you. What are you talking about? OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake? Absolutely not. No I didn't. Killer nanorobots? Sounds tough. Do you? Mmm hmm. Yep. Good luck. [closes door and locks it] [answering phone] Jim Halpert. Who is this? No, you can't fire me. OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert. Hey Pam! How are you? I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to? No, not at all. I have nothing to do. Oh yeah? The mall? Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes? Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice. Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good. I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say. Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola. Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak? Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead. Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess. Um... You're a jackass. No. Was that the hard way? Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them? Right. Okay. Wait, slow down. One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one. Absolutely, I do. At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me. To what? And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.' Oh yeah. I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure. Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground. What? No. What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam. Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing? But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away. All right. Yeah, what do you think that's about? I'm on it. You are not going to believe this. Well, tensions were high in the kitchen. Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey? Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone... Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off. Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking... I love their sandwiches too. Their bread is very good. OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off. Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. Sure, what's up? Oh no? No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me. That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great. OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday. I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there. What? What? [gives Dwight a high five] Great. Good. Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open. I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe. Thank you, thank you. OK. So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box? Right... That's good. Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic. Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks? Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give. OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box. OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no. But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover. If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair... No, no, dude, no. No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa. God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um... It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks. No thanks. No one wants to be you, Dwight. Is your password Frodo? Did you just change it to Gollum? [looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you? It was not rotting. Stop. Dwight, stop. Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo. Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble] We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off. Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes. You don't want to arouse suspicion. Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke] Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life. God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this? Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago. That's him. Uh, I heard it. Oh my God. I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and... Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here. You coming down? You gonna wish me luck? Whoa. Is that trash talk from Pam? Oh. Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along. I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah. Have a good game man. Really? I thought I'd take Roy. My bad. You know what? Let me take Roy. Take it easy. [to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good. I didn't sign anything. I'm trying, yup. Great, thanks. Forget it. It's just a dry erase board. Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it. Well, then keep it. [Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot] Cute, sure, yeah. She's not really my type. Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope. [glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really. Too late, Kev. Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems. She'd be perfect for you. So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager. Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss. Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there. It's all gold. Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back. You buy a purse. Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ? Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them. Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her. No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go. Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good. [mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta? Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens. Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all. I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much? [whispering] Here he comes, shhh... [gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good. He did pick a good one. A futon? He's a grown man That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off] Hi. I'm Jim, by the way. Hi Katy, nice to meet you. I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses. Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn. Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can... What's up? Thank you for choosing me. Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy. Yeah. Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos. And stuff... yeah. What are you doing? Okay. That's cool. That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right? Okay. Alright. Goodnight, Michael. I don't know. Grab a drink, I think? I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael] I got it. Have a good night. Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter. Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay? This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay. You're not going to freak out? Oh, really? Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So... I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit. Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high. Went well? You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it. Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup. Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot. Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work] Hey, Dwight. I need your stapler. Oh, great thanks. So, you ready for the... the Dundies? What? Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky. No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know? Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy. Yeah, gotta eat somewhere. Hey! How are ya? I thought you left? Oh! Oh. Yeah. [Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty. Second drink? [starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev. Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going. What a great year for the Dundies. We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding] What? Okay. I don't know, what? Oh my God! You are so drunk! Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on. He's a volunteer. Dwight come on, come- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, careful, careful. No you don't. Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there. Shoot. Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk. Alright. Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela. Mmm-hmmm. He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler. Well, you seem to have this under control. The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized. Good one. What award would you like to give Dwight? Okay. Dwight, this is crazy. Dwight, Dwight. The other volunteers. Hey. Um... I don't think so. Oh! There it is! Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.' Well done. Topical. Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy! Except pass that breathalyzer. I'm really excited to meet your Mom. Oh yeah? Good. Cause I have a lot of questions. Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist? I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it. No, thanks. I'm good. Does that include 'That's What She Said'? Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so... What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life. Hey. Yeah. Yeah? Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon. Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing] [looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk] Mm-hmm. No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh. Wind. Perfect. [misses] Oh. Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter? [points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean? Wait a minute, what is this? What? Really? Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years. [flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH! Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah. Why? Hey, do you guys have any other games? [bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day. Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games? Fair enough. [sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something. Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids. Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme] You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam? Hum. Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton. So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone? Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk. Here we go.  Here we go. Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis! Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton. Thank you, delegate from Iceland. Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow. Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis. Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it. Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration? Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal. What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that? Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work! Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15. Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys? Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er? [hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done. Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so. Hey. Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead? Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies. Notify the athletes. Michael. Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo. Nice. Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you. These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps] And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal. Um... 'Cause your condo's in America. Those are the doves. Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so... I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think? Okay, what? Okay. Nothing. What do you call it? Schruteball? Did you just come up with that? That is good. That's it. That's what it is. Wow. [cup tinkles] Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam. Okay. Mmm-hmm. Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know. Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office? Um, like stapler tennis or something like that. Okay. Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker. So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye. Okay. Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do? And, um... Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game. Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela. Nice. Third book? Okay. Phyllis. Nice. I guess. Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight. Nice. Smart. Okay. Thought people read more books. DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith? Wow. Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... . Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable. Unforgivable. Good. Pam? Get us back into it. Five movies. Go ahead. Ooh, definitely in my top five. What? Okay that's five. Pam, play by the rules. Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie. All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do? Um, not neccessari... Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then... Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back. Dwight. Dwight. Come on Dwight! Use words. Who goes to business school? He does? What? You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them. Yeah. You're right. Alright buddy. Nothing. Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling. [on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs... Hey. Good, how are you? Good to see you, too. Yeah, I am too. What answers? Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go. Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch? Yeah? Sure. Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that? Oh, the best. Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything. Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company. Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead. Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did. Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much. Yeah. Kevin, do it. Groundhog Day. Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay? And then you go to school for three years. Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it? A semester? Wow. Oh, yeah, it sounds like it. I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch. Oh, yeah. Okay, okay... Nice. Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types] Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India. Um. He sticks to his guns. Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay. Um... it's in Maryland. Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away] Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma. Um... yes. Michael, I really didn't mean to... I'm sorry? Oh, you want me to be you? Okay. Oh, are you firing Creed? We should switch seats in order to... Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal... Wow. That's an overreaction. Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you... Okay. Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought. [picks up the phone] Michael Scott here. Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth... It wasn't me. Yeah, I know. [motions for her to follow him] Come on. That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food. What's up, Hef? That is weird. Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk. Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it? I think you should retrace your steps. Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot. [On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model. I know. Uh, yeah, ream. Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work. [On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second... Umm... You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks. Was that your mom? Oh, I thought it was your mom. Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool. Ok. Uh, Larissa Halpert. 117 Mount Bergin St. You making this up as you go along, aren't you? Well, at least I don't have cavities. Thanks. Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist? No I'm not. Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt] Ok, say please. Please? Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou. Ok, Roy? Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael? Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so... Uh, how did you know they were black belts? Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right? I can't. I just got a manicure. Just have Dwight punch you. You know a ton of fourteen year old girls? Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright? Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael. Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips. Obviously. Yes. Uh, Kitchen. Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo? Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight... [Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting. Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything. [Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok. [Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up. What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now. Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend. What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar? I don't know.  He looks pretty scrappy. True. Meredith. Okay. Roy. Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael? No.  They're in the conference room. So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years. No... We are doing worst first dates. Wait, when was this? I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting. Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk] Agent Michael Scarn. How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings. Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like. Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott? Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones. Oh yeah- Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy. Dwight- Do you want to play- The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn? [reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters. Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the- A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface? Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so- That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry? Yeah? I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer. [Pam lights a candle] Wow. Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich. So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours. Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself. Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely. Jan didn't come back for her car last night. Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta? No way. Some might even say that we had our first date last night. Really. Cause there was dinner, by candlelight. Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date. You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic. Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game. Oh, come on, Pam.  I- Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right? Hey. What are you doing? Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go. No, not at all. Uh hmm. Sure. [reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop. Well, it's just a movie, Dwigt. Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head. Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute. Yup, I guess so. What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough. No.  Thank you. Done. S'ok. You're not having sex. Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that? Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors] Ok. We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders. No, we don't. Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease. I win. Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right? Duh. Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon. Ohh... Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'. [on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a... [pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon. Hey, how's it goin'? Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it? No, that was unbelievable. I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam. Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together. Oh- Yeah, no, I don't think you can. Ummm... no idea. Yes. Then why the question? I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim. Really? You have a better idea? I'll use that. So, that's... It's great. Yeah. You have fun? Did you go to first base? Oh, yeah? Did you go to second? Second. Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly? Pop-up? Really? So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he? Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically. Which one? He can't hear you? I know. Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk. What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do. Are we in danger? What? Hmm... No. [humming] Uh hum. It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real. Oh, uh, no. Could- Could, keep that down. Because not everybody knows about the party. Umm, Michael. Because it's a surprise. Uh hmm. So, don't tell. Ok. So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael. I know. [laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or... Oh, ok, cool. Hey. Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock. Oh, um... .I can't. Uh hmm, definitely. You do? Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'- Really? Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun. Improv sounds great. Alright. I think Stanley just coughed. Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy. That's because Mark's my roommate. Uh hmm. Oh, uh, later-ish. Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised- Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave. Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to. Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while. We can talk about that later. See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's- This is my desk. My home office, this is it. Ok, sure. Will do. Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right. You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts. Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all. Oh yeah. Thank you. Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin' fun? Chicken, hot dog, burger. There is soda inside. Oh by the way how's your side project going? Really? Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah. Oh? Uh, yeah, I guess. Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger. And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou- Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are. And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'. So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel. I think I did a pretty good job. Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret. Yeah? Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ? That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can .. Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag] Great. Where did you get it? He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag. There's a little more to it. What is Yankee Swap? I thought that was called Nasty Christmas. Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam. Sure you don't want the teapot? Right. No. No. Definitely. It's .. Got to be kidding me. Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people. I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it? Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck. Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you? You don't even drink tea. To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle. You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know. But .. Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside. I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't. Hey. What's up, buddy? Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good. Who, Steve? Oh, there it is. J1. Here, you know what? You can have some nickels. It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.' So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers. Yeesh, how old is this ship? I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right? Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck. It's not hilarious, but... Um, no. Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl! Well... Oh, um... [A long silence.] Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king. You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up. No. I don't know. Let's break up. What happened to you? Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking? What a night. She was always engaged. That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so... Yeah, I know. Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway. She's engaged. Huh. No, I really don't want to. Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And... Yeah. [off camera] Yeah, that's right. What? What's going on? I'm sorry? Pam. What is going on? Hey, whoa, Michael... It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened. You burned Oh... But you said that you went out with her this weekend. [sounds of a car crash] What was that... Oh! He hit the pole! It's broken right, he can't... Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh! He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper! So, where are you shipping your foot? So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now. Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today? And that isn't weird? Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall? I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill. You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot. Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion. Fine. Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator. What are you doing?  What, stop... [Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop. You can't lay down. Wake up. [sprays Dwight] I'm just gonna get... Just keep him awake. You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight? Well, I think she has a kid. Come on, get inside. We're going to Chuck E. Cheese. We're going to the hospital, Michael. Oh my God, Dwight, put that down. Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight] Give the bottle to Michael! [to Michael] Will you stop? Michael stop. Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight] Stop [sprays Michael] It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that. Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write? So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital. Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight] Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim. Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan. Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet. Uh huh. But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon. Ok. Bye. I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow. You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast. And doctors. I'm gonna pull the car around. Do you speak Spanish? No, I don't. Not much what's up with you? Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here? Nothin' much what's up with you? [mouthing] So close. Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant. Hey Michael. Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great. Umm, hmm. Nobody. Alright. Great. Thank you. I'm going with grape. Which one? I don't know what you mean. Uh, uh, ok. I'm going to take off actually. Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more. Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material. Thanks. I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room. No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here. Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out. Nope we're not brothers. Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks. Uh, I really don't want to talk about it. Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor. Uh-huh. What about you? Wow, that's not what I meant. Thank you. Thanks, thanks Dana. [Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature. Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting. Hey. Ah, coupon for a free sandwich. It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago. Big day. Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here. Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael. And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean. Oh you did? No, no, you saw through me, great. Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay. And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it. Ok. Hey. Umm, what happened? Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal. Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good? Good. Ready? Wow. Thanks. No, you what, seriously, you should have it. Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so... Oh, nothing. Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that. Oh, nothing. Hey!  Welcome back! So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot? Good!  What's goin' on here? What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting. [smelling the stink] Oh.  Wow. That might be a little difficult with the one computer. But there's definitely a desk open in the back. ...which I guess I'll be taking. No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back. Hey, Kelly. Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk. Allergy to... the desk? It's the lever on the side. No, I don't think I can... Hey! Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward. What do you think of Kelly? Are you interested in her? Really? She said lots of things. I have no idea. Yeah.  Sure. [on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye. Yep. What? Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing. Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat. Hey. So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right? And then you just changed desks, right? To one without a cubicle. So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh? So, that's how it's gonna be. What is? Thanks for the head's up, Kev. Oh, no, no. No. Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. I like talking to her too. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Cool, man. Ponies. Flowers. Hey! It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls? Did you really? Oh. Good. Nice. Well, what's it all about? I think you should do it. That's great! So you're not doing it. Why not? Come on. Roy said that. You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always? You are? Oh, that one was good. Do you mean vibrate? So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great. I dunno, it's on It was there when I sat down. Hey Kelly. What's up? OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away] Wow. Wow. No, don't be. I bet. Alright. [Kelly squeals] [on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye. Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in] [under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here. You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't. Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight. Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day. Animalian? Why? You're writing something? Okay. No, I'm not gonna do that. But I know how to spell it. Only if you tell me what you're writing. So now you're writing two things? Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody. Can we not? Still want that. Cugino's pizza. Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so... What did I do to deserve this? No. Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later. Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents? I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here. Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um... Can I go? So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions? What is that? I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice. When did you go there? Really for like how long? Where do I want to go? No. We're not. Which means absolutely nothing. Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go? Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip. You know I majored in Public Speaking in College. Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority. The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did. You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point. Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini. Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own Maybe. Thanks. Yeah. I'm definitely going. I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable. I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but... I'm... leaving on June 8th. Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just... Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out? Alright. Goggles? Bribery. Nice. The ocean. What are you reading? Aww, best book? Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be? Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped. Really? Yesss. And you're Abby, right? I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper. Let's start with... your mom. [shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand. Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight. That's pretty funny. Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy. Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods] Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date. Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play? I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am. Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official. Absolutely. Actually, I have the certification number right here. Yup. All right. A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do. No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme? Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday. Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out? Oh, okay. Kelly, you know what... Sometime today. Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and... So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back. Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number. [puts fabric softener into cart] ...What? Yeah, you don't? ...Okay. Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement. Just... quit stalling. Such a dork. How old are you? Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael. You... owe me. Think you can let go? Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by] Is that Michael? ...It's something to think about. Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done. You look cute today, Dwight. So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight [mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip. Whoa. You are a volunteer. And that's not the same. [interrupting] Volunteer duty. Well, your office is behind you. I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you. Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember. Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory? Now how do you know how it works? No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke? Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly] Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression. Oh... [mouths] C'mon! [presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face] Hi. How much time do you have left on your break? Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship? [growling] Nice. Yeah. Um, [gives Pam a look] Whoa. Yeah. [telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!'] Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out. Dwight tried to kiss me. And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it. Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it. Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends. [sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything? You mean your thoughts and feelings? Yeah... Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together. Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect. This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go. Oh. What did I write? [laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it. That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out. Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though. Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day. Maybe Stanford would be cool. Yeah. Maybe we should both go. Sure you do, Dwight. Sure. No, Pam. Pam, it wasn't her. I'm the one who complained about you. I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting. You know, it was one day. And I took it right back. It was like... [on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office] Oh, thanks. I don't know. Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it. Probably is. Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal. That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder. Maybe poison? My God! Not bad. What does Level Red mean? Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two? I can always kind of win at roulette. Yeah. Mind control. Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind. It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things. Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene] That doesn't exist anymore. I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan. Guys, the Afghanistananies. What are you doing? Till Death Do Us Rock.' Oh. Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams. Let's do it. Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here. [Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good. Yes. Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity. Let's take a look. Nice. What? Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer. Wow. Oh! Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna... No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding. Kev! [coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks. It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds. Yeah, right. What was this? [Makes face] Really? Wow. I think you're bluffing. Oh. Three nines. Thank you very much. It was fun. So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly? No, thanks. You having fun? Yeah, we all really... Well, I think you look great. Yeah, why did you? Oh, yeah. No. Okay, will do. Hey, how's it going? Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something? No, I... I was just... I'm in love with you. I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just... I just needed you to know. Once. Yeah. Don't do that. Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship. My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him. [after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that. No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk? Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok. I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable. Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right? Uh-huh, yeah.  I am. OooOK. I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name. Oh, I can do that. What's gay-dar? I miss that. Let's find out. [starts typing] Oh! Lots of results. It's really good to see you, man. Yeah, sold about forty thousand. No, it's not. I did. Yep. You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key. Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much. That is a lot of liquor. And a dart board. Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there. Yeah. All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care. Oh yeah? Oh, tell him I say hi. Hey, how is... Toby? Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to... Michael, it's really not a competition. Michael. Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard. Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker! Michael. Am I the first to arrive? Can I get a drink? Can I get a drink? Yeah. Michael... Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss. Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam. No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice. Nope, that's okay. That's all right. Yeah. Okay, maybe. Hey. How are you? No, we used to. Now we're friends. At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus. I'm just killing Germans, any way I can. [turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams? Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again? Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about... Um, sniper rifle? I'm sorry what are you whispering about? I'm trying--- Oh. What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles] Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim] [leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen] [playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty] Hey, Jan. [nervously] Pretty good. [baffled expression] Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad. Oh yeah, definitely. What's up? Oh. Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please. Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market. Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter. Really? Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen. I have no idea.  We went right for the copier. And then we checked the fax machine. [on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen]. Nice! Sounded good. Where'd I find what? I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door. Umm... sure. [chuckles] He's so cute. That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him? Sounds good. What? Is it? No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair. So I guess I can't get up. Sure. [sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me, Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me, Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Ah, hey. Hi. Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing. And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there? Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that? So... Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Oh, good. What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone. How far away did you think we were? Yeah. I have a question for you. How many words per minute does the average person type? Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90. Ok, I said average. Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it. No. 65. Ok, no need to laugh. Respectable? Right. Ok. Yeah. I know! No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later? No, you're making this up! Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories. And how many kitchens? Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley. Most apartments these days have like three. Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen? Pam? Pam? Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too. Oh, no no. Yeah, uh, well. Ok. Yeah. Bye Pam. See, that's weird. I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film. Sorry. I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work. Thank you. Scuse me? Wow. Yup. Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds. What's that? Yep. Oh, Holy Mother of God. Good. Oh. Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike. Okay. Oh. I'm a drunk driver. Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli. No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right. So good. Nope, I got eel. Hey. Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain. I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.' Really? Wow... that's bad. Well, I work here now. I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans. Hey, do you have a second? I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton? Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants? What does that mean? Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that. Wow. Thank you. No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um... No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think. Okay. I really don't know.  How you doing with all this? You'd actually move to Scranton? New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York? Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it. Okay. The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats. Yeah. You know what? I think you just need to meet him. Sounds good Andy. Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later? Right. Okay. Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here. Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met... Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good. You, too. Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand. Hey, Dwight. Okay. Sounds good. I don't know what you're talking about. No. Looks good. I'm not. I am. Okay. Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now? Oh. You know, man, it's really you're call. [whispers] Let me get that for you. This one taken? No. Good. Hey, Toby! How are you, man? I just wanted to say hi. Oh. Is that like your new thing? No. It's cool. All right. Good to be back. All right. No problem. [off camera] ...what? Kelly! Really? Great. What's new with you? Oh, this looks promising. It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'. Terrible. Totally unconvincing. Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian. You feel good? All right. Hey! Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase. Well, I'm evolving, Pam. Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled. Okay. Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm... Don't... All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work. All right! Does he ever. Yeah, it does, actually. [talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli? [laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day? Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back? Ok, thanks. Hey. I thought you had already... left. Oh... Good. Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something. I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh... O..ok. Um..good. Right. Yeah. Good to be back. Hey, Kev. How you doing? Okay. Smart. Good. [to Angela] Hey, Angela. Bye, Angela. All right, Kev. See you later. Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley] Huh. Seems like a nice enough guy. What about, uh.. [points at Meredith] Really? Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed] For the North. Obviously. Sorry. Man. [Pam hesitates and then leaves] Yeah. Hey. Just about... yup. Now. Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet. [picks up phone] Jim Halpert. ...Okay I can't... help you... with that. She is dating Ryan, I think. She's... high-maintenance. Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one. ...Absolutely you should. I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates... Frisbee-based competitions... She... Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin? Jonas Salk. Justin Timberlake? What is that, like... five pounds? Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam. Quick question - do you play the guitar? Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice? Yup. That's perfect. Hey. Perfect. ...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him. ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but... Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else. Where... did you learn all of this? So, not prison. What'd you do, Prison Mike? That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike. Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm. Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out. Merry Christmas Dwight. Wow. What have we got here? Dead goose. All right. Wow. Win-Win. Wow. What kind of bike is that? But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael? [Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy [Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol. It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word? What? Are you serious? [Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow. [closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know? No, because of the promotion. It just feels a little bit, like... I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing? Will they still air 'Rudolph?' Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right? OK, I think I can help here. As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.] Permission denied. OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. Yes. No, it's not. Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep. Probably. And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it. Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing. I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too. All right [high fives Kevin] What a horrible, horrible movie that was. Thank you. No. She wasn't. Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago. Sorry. You what? Yeah. You just had a rebound. Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart. [to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. Oh no, that would be great. Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter? So, really, you're just calling her? All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this? For what? OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm? Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing? You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office. Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife! No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?! [picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet. Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies. You want to talk about it? Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.' Yikes. Fantastic. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen. Really? So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much. Hmm, what? Yeah, I guess. Hey, thanks a lot. Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing] Urkel Grue. Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper] Definitely. [raises hand] Are you stoned? In the picture, are you high? Is that not what happens when you're high? Oh, loves it. Green walls. Ooh... fancy. [Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice. Okay. Hello. Yeah, you can. For this? Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend. Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he? Yeah. Right? Ok. Yup. I'll trade. Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot. Seriously? You're going to sit in the back? You still do that thing? After you sir. Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front. We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser. Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked. We have discount prices on ink cartridges... And, also, any forms that you are going to need... We can custom make them. Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service? [Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, Kelly, it's Jim. Thanks. Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence. We should go on a double date. Sure. Look at you! Beesley, coffee? All right. Yeah. No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five] Which one was it? Cool. Oh Yeah. Can I see it when I get back? Congratulations. Big deal. Ok. Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something? Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay? Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves] Is that you singing? Nice job. You gonna answer it? Yikes. Thank you. I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win. Hey. So Andy is in rare form today. Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something. Fine. Party pooper. Hey, Ryan? You wanna pull a prank on Andy? I liked you better when you were the temp. Would you like to pull a prank on Andy? Okay, good. Stay right here. [hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages? So weird. No. What are you talking about? You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling. Okay. [inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall. [imitating Andy] 'It's not freakin' funny!' Hey. [long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes. Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So... Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights. Hey. Ugh. Oh yeah.  Why? Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking. Yeah, I know I should. No, I'm sure you're right. Really? Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there. Absolutely not. Stop.  That's disgusting. Fine. Sally. Blonde. Are you okay? Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants. Yep, Spongebob Squarepants. Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania. Have you ever seen a stripper before? Yeah, me neither. Hi. [Phone rings] Oh God. Michael, Dwight would like your man meat. Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley? Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid? In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment. [Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid? [Windows reboot sound] Altoid? [Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight? What are you doing? What? So what's in the box? Those flowers are nice. Phyllis and Robert. You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers. Did you ever see that movie? You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out. Hey. When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves? Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want. I know. It's very cute. Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical. Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen. Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on. Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six. I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd... The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well. Ow! That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot. What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre. Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare. The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding. So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control? Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight. OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia. Those are the books that sum up the other books. What are you reading? Oh, that could be interesting. [clears throat] I am ready. Five. Hmm... Five. Yeah. No, I got it. Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you? Another worm? Like, are they friends? Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car. Yeah. Thanks. Oh. Um. I think we're good. Yeah. Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless? Yep. Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me. Gotcha. Alright. Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care. Oh. Hadn't noticed. No, it was before I knew you so, its fine. Oh. You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace. Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me. So, none of them? Really? Ok. I don't know. Where to begin? My ball. Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar. I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds... Agoraphobic? Really? Absolutely correct. Kev, have a good weekend. Here we go... Ok... Sounds good. Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim] I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars. Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you. Okay.  Um... Got you something. You don't know what it is. It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven. Where'd you get that? Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise. I can't hear you. Still nothin'. No. Nice. Okay. And what happens in this one? Okay. Can I have a raise? [softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher. What? I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened. So, none of that tipped you off? Yeah, that was nuts. No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection. We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday. Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it. Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something. Boy I--- It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating. Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do? Thanks, Kev.  I'm good though. What's what? Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor. [under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice... [scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even. Hey, Andy.  How are you, man? What's that? No, I'm not gonna call you that. Andy. Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug. Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks. [half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that's too far. You really wanna bet? Ok, you're on. No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'. I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out. There's like ten green ones. I'm gonna say fifty. Oh, don't be that person. Kev's out. Okay, okay. Okay. I'd say like... 10,000 to 1? Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee. Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part. Oh my God, there Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself. Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured. Dwight... Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries. OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this. Come on. Come on. He'll listen to you. Oh! No no no! OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy] [Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best? False.  Black bear. Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica. Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars. ... MICHAEL! [on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this. One more.  Why are you talking like that? Yeah, I gotta call out on that. All right. Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone. Oh, did the press ask for a story? What's that? You know her name. It's fine. What about music?  Do you have any music? I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD. Lord, beer me strength. Did that Oh, is she that teacher in the white? Which one... is she? Wow. No, I don't think so. Nope. No. No. Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a Andy--- Ohh... Oh my God. Well... that's not gonna hold up in court. All right. Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony. Probably Absolutely. And you should. Andy... is having a Good luck.' You want music? Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right. [singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... Do you? OK. [Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that. Spot on. Oh, my God! Wow. Then you did nothing wrong. We should go. She looks older. No. Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera]. What's that? Oh. You don't have to tell me this. You shouldn't be talking about that. Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods. No, can't help you now. No. D- Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away. Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously. Don't do it. That's okay. What? No, that's your conscience. Listen to it. [sits down next to Denise] So, high school. Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry. You should take up a musical instrument. Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right? No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking? How old do you think I am? [shakes head] Not that I know of. I drive a Saab station wagon. Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy? Yup. [to Pam] Hey. [Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this? [reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already. Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean? Lay it on me. Now that sounds serious. Which would be me. OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation. Oh, you don't want to know. OK, I'll call the [on the phone] OK. [on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls. Mm... not really, no. [raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces? Wait a second, how are you qualified for that? Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls. No. Thank you, though. Not really. I've seen a bathroom before. I think you mean a girl's Go crazy. [in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool. Anna Maria's. Six-month anniversary. What? No, we've been dating for six months. Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend. [snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool. Hey, Dwight. It's Jim. No, you're not. I'm looking right at you. Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator. I saw him two minutes ago. In the women's bathroom, above the sink. No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this. That's pretty cool. Really? Not Slytherin? I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort. [starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! [to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole. Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left. [to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes! You can't say, or you can't pronounce it? What are you doing? Yeah. No. Good. Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day. [on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye. In well? How would that work in well?  I just want to know. Wait a minute. If this job is in a well, I don't want it. I don't! Nope. Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned. That's harsh. And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself. Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement. Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure. Just one. The torches are lit. No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard. Are you not gonna put out the torches? Okay. Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat. He's gonna throw up. Hey, Kev. Thank you. Ohhh... No. No way. [exhales loudly] Andy... Nothing. Yup. Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless. Thanks, Pam. Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it. So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city. Whoops. Hmmm. Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right? All right. Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. You sure? Wow. Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else? Hm. Really tough call. You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got. All right. [smiles] Oh hey, Dwight. Does my room have cable? Can I change rooms? Can I have a late checkout? You're not the manager even in your own fantasy? Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil? Go. Yeah, bigger actually. Mm-hm. Unbelievable. She could put the cup right there. Thanks. Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or... Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish? Oh... Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.? Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip. [Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. Oh do you mean when I get the job? You mean Kevin? Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street] [points at bearded man] Who's that? Beardy? I'm gonna introduce myself. Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though. Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want. Okay. Sure. Thank you. I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh] Thanks. I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs] Yes, absolutely. Oh, no, absolutely. [hands David his papers] There you go. [not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus. [thinks] The friendships. [flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet? The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here. And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back. Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight? All right.  Then... it's a date. Really, what kind of celebrity? How much did you pay for it? You paid for it? I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody. Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain. Yeah. What? Who was driving? One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then. Oh good, so we don't have to work. I can also take 3 people. I think she's awake. I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it. I will do some research. Six of one, really. So what's your strategy for this race? Mm-hmm. What? Why won't more people do that? [laughs] [looks at camera] What? [Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah... I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything. Right! Wow! There it is. It is going really great. Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check. Yeah. Bat birth control Which we are. You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events. Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips. Baquette. Eww. I can imagine. You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room? [sighs] Gross. Alright. [naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach? Oh, would you look at that. Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in? OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured. That's what I thought. Right. Let's do some good. Oh, and I get to carry it. ...talk about it. What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or... Well, you're probably dehydrated. Glass of water would be a start. Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day. You are? I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM? Definitely not. Conference room? Hey. Oh wow, thank you. I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some? I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you. Ummm... yup. Yes, we are. Actually, we've been dating for a couple months. Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings] Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company. Oh. Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...? What? Oh, OK. Great. [Jim and Pam walk away] Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!'] Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months. Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun. Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything? Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago. Oh no, we're just sitting here. OK. And... that is why we waited so long to tell people. Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot. Hey, Amy.  How ya doing? [under his breath] Nice to meet you. Hey. Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone? I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh? Be honest. That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it? For me, it was. Alright. Why don't we just go by ourselves? What about a gift basket full of cash? Yeah, he's definitely something. That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing? I guess he can't get any girl he wants. Into a lake. I know.  I love it there. Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun. Sounds great. Yeee... (grunts in frustration) That was slightly harsh, don't you think? You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight? As opposed to... What about cars? They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes. Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family. Thanks. There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it. [to Pam] Wait for it. Hey Meredith, how you feelin'? Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so... Haha... Uh-huh. MmmHmm... Oh yeah. Alright... Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us? Actually it sounds like you are. Or zipadeedoodaah. I was... mocking. Or a gong. Really?  Power gel? What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working? What? Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person. [dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper. Sure we'll go. Oh I'm sorry.  What? Nope. Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie. How's it going? Yeah? You look a little worried. Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper. Hey man. What's going on? Oh yeah? I'm driving? Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam. Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it. Yeah. It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book. What was that? Oh.  Two kisses. Gotcha. That would be fun. Uhhh.  Can't. Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right? Mmmkay... Uh, that is an invitation to an online party. Yep. Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address? Yep. Oh actually I withdrew from consideration. You need to let him go. Yes. Yes, but not by kidnapping. As a hostage. I think you're under-thinking it. Ransom. What did he say? So, we should let him go. Okay. Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands. Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof? Okay. What have we got here? Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors? Which one's this? Perfect. Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk? And that's when I knew. You? That was the moment that you knew you liked me? Wow, can we make it a different moment? A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge. Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday. How long have you been a man? That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom. [talking on phone] Sure, I can hold. Hey Dwight. Do you run the bed and breakfest? Does the Department of Health know about this? Uh, Michael. That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight. Darn it! No, can't. Where are you going out tonight? I wouldn't understand or a secret? I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow. The Beets Motel? That is, wow. How are you doing this? Nice. Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story. Not even Harry Potter? Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6. Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight. You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less. [Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there? Hey Dwight. Does Mose have nightmares? Oh yes. Ever since the storm. Yeah, yeah. Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here. Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying] You okay? Are you a cocktail waitress? No, sometimes its right. Dwight, how's the hotel business? Have you checked Trip Advisor recently? Maybe you should. The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings. You will never want to leave your room. Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton? Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam. Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you. Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be. Yeah? Okay. Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food. Right back at ya. Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea. Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle] Okay. Yes, they do. Where's Dwight? The office. Hmm. You're doin' great, buddy! I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show? [not watching Mose]  More spins. Nobody tell him! You got it, you're so close! Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think... Nope. I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide. You playing that game again? Oh it has losers. Who are you talking to, specifically? Hey. Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality. Yeah. [sighs] Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever. Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so--- Yep. I... why don't we go back to this animation. Ah, show me how this works. I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one. Okay. Do you want me to stay? Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home. I, ah... Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns. You're welcome. Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player? Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it. Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam] I just thought you should--- Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam] Okay. I don't want - Mmm... All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but... Yup. Right. Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got. Love it. Mm, can't do that. Definitely can't do that. You know what? Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial. I'm just doing my job, man. Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone] What?  What? What? Okay, make a commercial. Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns] Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before. Oh, I don't think that is what's happening. So tell me again why I can't be part of your club? Oscar? So what are you going to do? Did they? We just passed the exit for Corcroan. What are we doing? We're going to Utica? I'm not going to Utica right now. No. I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend. No, I'm not calling Karen. What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight! Are you kidding me? Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so... Okay. You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here. Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing? Oh, God. [hangs up phone] No. No, no absolutely we are not doing this. Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time? So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache. What? Okay, you know what? Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about? It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. That doesn't make sense, couldn't be. Oh my God! Michael, watch the road! Michael! Michael, pull over! Pull over, pull over! I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening. No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car. Guy's going by. Shh. No, no, you won't do that. Nope. Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please? Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go. Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done. Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me. No, no, don't do anything to them. Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home. Isn't that thing huge? No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this. Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all- Damn it guys! Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back! No, I'm not doing that. No, I'm not doing that! Hey Karen. First of all, hi. You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so... Copy that. Yes? Yeah, trying to quit though. Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you... I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you... [slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic. I... will... [gives up and walks away] Hey. Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club? [Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I. Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, that wasn't fun. Of course I read it. Angela.  Nope.  The ashes. Well, you're driving, right? Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back. Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it. I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die. Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it. Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure. All right, I'm gonna go now. Okay, I will. [idiot voice] You embarrassed me. Got it. Absolutely, yes. When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes. Yeah? And I am always busy. Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood. Is there a limit? Well, is that it? Or? How so? What's that? Right. Not gonna change. I thought we had that looked at. Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this? OK, great. Yup. That'd be great. Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday? I do remember, yeah. You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party? There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are. And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault. So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive. We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time. It's a pretty good idea, don't you think? No... I think it's a great idea. You know, try sending them another invoice. Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way? Right? I was just thinking... Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes] What's that? Oh, sure. OK. [Meredith leaves] Yeah, people like me I guess. Well I think Meredith was just -- Everybody's birthday. What do you want? You want a birthday pie? Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie. It will be Angela. Andy. Not your birthday. Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no. Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make. Alright. [Andy rolls back] OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here. Hey guys, what're we talking about? Toby. Oh, thanks man. Is there anything -- Oh, OK. What? I remember that. Seriously? Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon. OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right? That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing. Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it. Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact. Hey. Sure glad you're back. You have no idea. Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once. So, terrible idea. You did do it? Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years. That's what who said? That's what she said. How much time do I have? All right, let's run it back. Sure. Wow. Oh, I can't beat Darryl. What, seriously? What is she saying? So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly? Bring me players. Good game Meredith. Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice? [Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell? Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so... I think I'm ready. ...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores] Do you want to go play on the table upstairs? So, where did you learn how to play? My friend's basement. All right, ready to start? What are you doing? Right. There, first... I think that's the question that you had... Wow. [heads toward the conference room] All right. What are you guys doing? Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch] Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table. Do you? Yup. Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you? Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working. I think you did. Oh, I- Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate. Hi. Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago? I have been getting ready and then driving over here. Really? Tour, let's do the tour first. Oh, you guys doing a little construction? It's fire. Just like that. Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short. Wow. What is that chestnut? Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool. Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see. What was that? Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone] You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage. That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much. I don't know because I everything I own is there. Katie Holmes. Oh, Dawson's Creek. Not really a rhyme. Tom Cruise! Oh no she just put it in front of my face. I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company? [to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other? Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions... Nevermind. That's nice. It's getting late. [Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course Oh... my apartment's on fire Flooded. You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad. [holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe. We should probably get back. I didn't have anything, Jan. I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating] What's that? So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there. Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken. Oh, you don't know her. Your mom. Michael, you didn't even know her. [walks up to reception] Margaret? You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh] Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud. OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs] Have I not proposed to you, yet? Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles] No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame. Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works. Wait, I'm serious. It's happening. And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp. I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating. Nice. [fist bumps Kevin] Where do you want to go for dinner? Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe? What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh. No, no, no. I actually know a sex model. Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem? Okay. Yes. Oh, yeah. How'd you get gum in your hair? But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter. Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am. Hey man, you mind if I run something by you? Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that. Thanks. Did I? I don't... Hmm. Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one. And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?' What? I'm gonna go to my desk. I know. I can't. I'm not single. Pam. You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow. So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one. Thanks a lot guys, Good job. Nice job everybody. Great work. Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now. You really don't have his phone number? Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or... It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick. It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or... No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar? Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here? [on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it. Yup... [on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up. Haaank. Is that you? Still haven't left the house yet, huh? Good. Please hurry. Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling. [notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us. I... just... if they speak Spanish. Lucky us. Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby] No, that was his wife, so he's on his way. Well, he'll be here really soon, Kev. Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility. Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer. Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation. Yeah that's true. If you were a real star you would put your face in it. We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man. Greatness is only skin deep, some people say... Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside... And in this case... That's also not true. You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly... Would... Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world. What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep? An urban thing... Oh boy... On a wing and a prayer, mostly. A formal warning... [chuckles] [stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head. I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really... Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff... Yeah... That's not a good idea. Who? Let's go. Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here. Who else is he mean to? Mm-hmm. Hey. She's never worn these glasses before. Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash. A formal warning, seriously? And no one cared. Productivity?  My numbers are good. Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try. Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years. Great! Hey, so how's the direct mail business going? Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or- Absolutely, will do. So I guess I'll just... work on my short game. You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey. Yep.  [Maguire keeps swinging] Hey, can't really talk now, what's up? Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see. Oh, I like you. Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs? Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me? Absolutely. You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good. I closed it! Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch] If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy. Yeah, well, you know...Cornell. [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight. Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second... And how many would you like? Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately. Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset. [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight. Yes it is. Oh, thank you. I've been working out. Can't do that. Unsanitary. [office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight. Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine. Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman. Hey... What? No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations! Yes! So when do you start? Wow. Busy morning. It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great. See how easy that is? [on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big. Thanks. I just- No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so... All right, well it already went through, so... Hello? That's not it. Yeah. Close. Mmhmm. What are the two levels? Mmhmm. Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level. Yes. You don't love Holly. But you just met her. Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that. Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance. Yeah. We've been through this. Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow. Well, we're really happy. And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her. I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work. I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party. Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it] Well we all want a good party, right? I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap! [on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply] What'd you do? Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel? Oh, I'm so glad you didn't. There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey! Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan? [clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up] Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles] Classic. Not my favorite, but... It's not my favorite... [gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey... I know. That's awesome, man. That's great. Hi. He didn't mention me, did he? Thanks, Toby. I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam. Scared me.  How's the party planning going? So it's going great, sounds like. Hey. That's cool. Sure! Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera. Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it? Do you honestly believe that? I'm gonna get a second opinion. Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on. Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard. Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great. Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him. Okay, what's going on? [smiles, looks to Michael]  Really, nothing? Ah, they moved the shower. No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why? Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts. But what have you learned about her? Nice. Well, I tried. [Michael laughs] I'll just go later. So you have the directions. You have a toothbrush. You have a cell phone charger. Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes. What happened? Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam] Bye. Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here... I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork. I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her. When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father. All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications-- All right! So what is going on, girl in the computer? Uh-huh. That's not what that is. I would like to lose 65 pounds. Cryogenics. Beer me five. All right, I'm taking off. Nope, just going to see Pam. Maybe put up some shelves. OK, thank you for ... this. No. [knocks on door] Hi. Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door] [watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out. Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service? But he did, right? All right. Nope. Mmm. How much weight have you lost, Dwight? No, you're definitely the problem. Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers. Fair question. See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you. Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer? So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so... I know.  I suck. Dwight says 'Hi.' Now he is saying 'Hi' louder. Umm... Hey, can you go to IM? OK. I'm gonna write you up for not working. [holds up an ASCII image of Dwight] Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late. Perfect. [Jim gets down on one knee] I just... couldn't wait. Pam, will you marry me? So? Hey, sorry everybody. Hey Dwight. What's up, Meredith? No, you're not. [sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight. [as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not? No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too. When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.' Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi. Why, what happened? Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them. I just didn't, you know, want a deal. OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged. Nope. Thank you Angela. Yes. To get married. Yep. [Michael hugs/tackles Jim] Nice. [they bump fists] Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time? Jackpot. [starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds. Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure. Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds. [stops the watch] One second. Hey, Andy. By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night? Actually not.  It was really so-so. I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight? You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake. Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor. He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today. [Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds? So I guess I can assume that was personal. So maybe you're not completely ethical after all. Oh, but you mean other than embezzling? Fraud. [drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion. Right, the one from England. Oh. Right, that style. OK... Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen? OK. [clearly just humoring her] No... way! Ha ha. That's hilarious? Who, Stacy? Uh... OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story. [Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan. What do we have here? Really... [on phone] Hey!  You busy? OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her. The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes! Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later. [on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message. [walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03. You must be out or something. Is it me, or are we just a little off today? Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues. Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you? Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe. Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway... I miss you. Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though. We were robbed last night. So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning. I'm on minute six of this message. The future mother of my children. Do you need us for any of this? 5 dollars. I can see that. Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar] Hey man. Oh, I wouldn't-[clears throat] I'm good. How you doing? Yeah, okay. Oh, she's good actually. She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school. Yeah, she's doing really well. She's engaged, um... to me. Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that. Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM. What? [driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs] [driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around] I just don't know if he's presidential enough. Cranford?  No.  We will never watch that. Ah, I'm sure they're all great. Let's start with the wildcard. Mmm-hmm. Uh-oh. I think I got a pretty good sense of that one. Yep. Let's move on to the next. Mmm-hmm. Oh, that's good. I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card. Mmm-hmm. Have you asked her what she wants to do? No.  You got that backwards. Dave. You are?  [Andy hisses] A cat? [phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert. Hey New York, Happy Halloween! Oh, I'll walk you out. All right. We'll see. [to camera] No. I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two. Hey, how are you? Good to see you. All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable. That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually. Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal? Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her. That must be really fun for you and Marci huh? Love that one. Here you go again! What is your deal today? One. Half. Also good. Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit? Pam, don't worry about it. Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter] Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got? That is good. Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.' Yeah, we'd never do that. You wouldn't tell your mom? Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger. Aww. [on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody. Nope. You must be really proud. Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here. OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy. How can you even be sure? [holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it. Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something. It is... more of a spicy brown, actually. How was your meeting with Michael? Was it your scores? Mm-hmm. Of course. Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers. There's the charm. That is me. Wish me luck. Thanks. I love you, too. I'm not talking to you. What? Did my scores drop a little? Are we even sure that's my file? Well, there's got to be an explanation. Yeah. I think you mean smug Michael, I'm just trying to -- I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year. A little bit. ... Worth it. Microgement. [picks up phone] Hello? Wow, that's great, because I need paper. Wow, this is my lucky day. I am Bill Buttlicker. How dare you? My family built this country, by the way. Would you hold on one second? That's my other line. Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone] Sorry. That was a family emergency. You know what? That's private. Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing. You're gonna have to talk louder. Son, you have to talk louder. Louder, son! Now, you listen to me, sir. The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult. I'm irate right now. Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this? Well, this is William M. Buttlicker. Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today. There is one condition, Michael. You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly. Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view] Are you serious? OK, what are you -- What's that? Who's they? In this car? [turns radio down] What are you thinking? The mob, maybe NASA. Is there some evidence? How many shoes do you need? I'm not talking to you. Pam. No, she's not. [behind Dwight]: OK. Easy. Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk. Good one. [enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way. Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but... Hey, how are you and Darryl? Bye. What was? No, actually. I don't think so. Hey, how's things? Yeah? Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me? Wait, that's pretty weird. Well, Andy has a mug just like that. No. What party? I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party? Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks] [walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis] Dwight, let me see your coffee cup. Is that it? OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party. Probably just Kelly. That's what I'm saying. You were right. You were right. You knew it. You knew it the whole time, buddy. Wow. No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this. We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks. Who's that? Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close? That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear. I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you. Don't. Perfect. So, how you holdin' up? You know what you should do? Take a vacation. We should take a look at those surveys. Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles. [peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight. So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre. Why are you telling us this? Where are you going? Where is it? Okay. Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back] Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird. [in office] Are you sure? Wow. I thought you were good at Flash. Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek. [looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay. It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream. And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right? [concerned look on face] You okay? Okay. Alright. Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying] [noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already? Excuse me? I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee. Thanks man. I missed you. Welcome back. So why did you come in here? Why is that, why is that weird? [laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other. Toby works here again. Oh no. You don't know. You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back. Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that. That's really not cool. Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right. Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right? Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam? Oh thanks, Phyllis. Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry? Definitely we should. Mmhmm, yeah. Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still? No. [laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close. Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so... [walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home? Cool. I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah! I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door] [outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just--- You do? Really? Oh my God... Yeah, I did. [they kiss] No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about. Yeah, I can't... really can't move him. Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier. Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything. You have to make the decision. Hey. Mmhmm. Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier. Yeah. Beesly, are you threatening me? Okay. [shudders] Whew. Woah, you guys going to lunch? Mind if I join? All right. Let's go. Let's do it. Where we going? Michael, that is hilarious. Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings. Yeah. You look really pretty. [Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you. Yeah? There they are. You got it. Okay. Oh! [on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you. Let me call you right back. Okay. Wait, what? Truce? Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam] Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas. Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping. I think it'll take you a little longer than that. Ah. You brought in your doll collection. That's the Christmas spirit. Yes. I will grant you one wish. Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb. What is it? Wow, that is delicious. Can't believe no ones thought of that. [Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh! Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day? That's cool. Well what if we can't do it quickly. Yeah. Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that. Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us. [watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes. [Andy playing the sitar] Hey. Do you take requests? Please stop. People are having a Christmas party. You did not know it. Everyone knew some of it. You knew it. She knew it. No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead. [getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope. Nothing. Why don't... Let's... How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second... Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office] No, no. I know. Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward. We can't figure that out. No. Please stop. When? This is really not how this is supposed to happen. Stop. What? Okay, listen. This shouldn't happen at work. And! This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue. Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything. But you're leaving... [to Dwight] What are you standing for? You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin. Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit... You okay, man? Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit? Nope. Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because... Hey. It is my business when it happens at work. So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God. [collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe] Thanks Meredith. Dwight! Are your legs broken? Andy, are you all right? Looks like a red wire. Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires. Doesn't it? Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks] I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there. Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work. Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it. [snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand] Thank you, accounting department. I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people. Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate? OH! [the 'yes she's hot team' claps] [entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying. Back door. Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping] What?! No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this! No. Michael. Michael. [everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael! How's that gonna help you? Right. And we don't know how. Punishment fits the crime. [after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on? Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage. I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then-- You couldn't of memorized that? Gimme a break. [to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast. Hey. Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal. What? Mmm... [laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods] Don't open your eyes. What? Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away] Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents... Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary. Do ya? Ok. Remember Spider face? OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface. Yeah... yep. Yep. You're being replaced. He just sent a text... So what did he say? Was it my fault? You ok? Are you alright? This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left. [disgusted groan] [sighs and knocks on Michaels door] That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh... What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors] I didn't, I'll look somewhere else. All right. [front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly. Whoa! What was that all about. [Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead. Okay. Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama. [pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy. Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life. So this is fun. We just wanted to say we are very sorry. [while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do? Okay. [partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding? Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons? What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period. Not even an exclamation point? I can't believe how bad this looks. Okay, good then. I am working on it. Six dollars. I said I was working on it. [over the phone] How old's Kelly? It's Mose. Who do you think it is? Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she? Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation? [leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party. Oh, great. [looks at a three dollar bill] Hey! What the hell's goin' on? What? Yep. Got it. Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy. Hey, you know what? I got you a cake. And... ta da. How do you hate it? It's a cake. Right. I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know. Birthday. Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl. Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake. Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about? You know what? I could use a little help. We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign? You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3! I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means. [grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting. Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved? Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one. Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome. [to camera] Didn't see that one coming. Not a surprise. What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly? You haven't heard our theme, though. That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television. Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping. Yeah? No. All right. Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel. Thanks. [both eat cake] [approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya? Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours. Jimbo! [impersonating Fonzie]  Ayyyy! Ayyyy! You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but. Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine. They're for her to look at, Michael. Yes, let's have a word. Oh, I'm sorry. I understand that. Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key. We do. That sounds fun. I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves. Oh yeah, I understood. No way, a 280? Yikes. No.  Bob, no. No! That is a lie, that is a lie. But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit. Nobody asked, Bob! I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat. Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food. We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom] Here they come. No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough. Oh great, I have to cover? Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed. We were. [emerging from the Men's room] Empty. Oh boy. OK. So... Oh initially I did. Ding Dong. KGB. Ding dong. Ding dong. The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs] We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends -- Free paper.' What are you doing? [to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know. What power? Well guys with girlfriends don't. [on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background] [on phone] I'll take that down right now. I'm on the phone. [on phone] Hold on one second. [to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania. [on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't. How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments? OK... ...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales. So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too. Absolutely not, I'm mad at you. Good one. All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance. No, that is what I mean. No, stop it. You cannot take the fall for him. He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do? There it is. You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years. And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize. Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs] Who is it? Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second. Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine. If you want to come back then, that'll be fine. I get back from work around 6. You can try. That, that might work. Alright. [wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough? I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember. And of course, classy. Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously. That's it. Or Mr. Peanut. Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind. Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits. That's inspired. De class���. Hey. Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today. Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or- Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know. I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him. Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh. Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam] I thought it'd be funny. Thanks, Charles. No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please. You pet the animals and they pet you back. Hey. Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office. Second-in-command to Michael. Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me. Assistant regional manager, yeah. No, not exactly. Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that. Yep. [shuts door behind him] See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye! And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear. [Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying. You called any headhunters? Right, cause that's what we are talking about. [overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular. Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh. I would prefer not to. You're starting your own paper company? Why? Do you know the industry is in decline? Right. No, I did that before, it added nothing. Okay. [keeps eyes open] I am not gonna do this. And you are not going to, either. Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing. Hey. Nothing, just talking. I didn't... no. I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else. Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else. What? What? Pam! Pam! You can't be serious. Still no. Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you... I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye. [phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev? Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that. No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier. It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again. Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.] Kev, c'mon. [whispering] Would you please stop that? You're breathing very heavily. No it's not. Oh no. I was just - ... Yes. I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly. Uh, no. Nope. Not really. It's 'cause I'm more of a player. You bet. Well I do. I play. Well, maybe you should get back to work. Maybe we will someday. Yeah. Let's... eh... see ya. Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team. Oh, there he goes. Yikes. Aw, man. Oh! Goal! Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst. Left. Forward, definitely. Striker! Alright! Let's do it. Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping] What? Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice. I'm sorry, Phyllis. LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair] You realize you're not actually talking to me, right? The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had. Hi! [Awkward] Sure! Okay. What the hell's a rundown? When did you need that rundown by? Okay. Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it? Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is? Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles] This rundown better be really good'? Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients. No. I can't. It was like, hours ago. Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with. I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now. Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ? Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard. No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should. No, I.... Hey! Okay. There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for. Yeah sure. You want to look at it first? No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...? The one I have. I'll use the one I have. Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown. Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right. Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love. I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost? I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake. Am I going down a road? It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this. I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up. Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said- -I just don't know if I can do it. It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy. [both laugh] You know that I was doin' this. Okay. [Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call. Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck! Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back. Forget it. I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it] Oh, God. Hey. Okay. Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together. And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will. When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations. Sorry. Her day. Are they looking at me? Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me. Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew! Oh, they're my client. Hey, David. [makes kissing, puckering sound] Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers? Really? Does he do good work or-- [opens phone] Hey. I saw you called. Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay. Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring. Good, right?  Hello. Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it. Now, this is the projection over three months? Oh, but you didn't. Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so-- I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction. Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit. Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second? Actually here for something else. You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales. David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out. Oh! Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout. Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs. Missed the last part. Got it. Great work Dwight. No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right? What are your top five cases? Because you've solved zero cases. Got it. Can you give us a hint? Can I address that? Okay. Of course.  What is like a hostage? Strongly-painted picture. Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly. Great.  See you upstairs. Hey, you have a second? Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen. This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.",ENTP,Ne,Ti
Karen,"Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that? [laughing] Yeah. Scared? [with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty! [whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade. I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around. Just tap S then D. [her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No? [throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away] Um, shoot.  Uh, I will.  Sorry. [at vending machine] Dammit. Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips. But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority. Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now? I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want. Yeah, all day. Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that? Mm. Yeah, nothing there. [laughing] Six? I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal. [on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir. Thanks. [spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them? [squeaky chair] Hey. My chair is squeaking. You took my chair. When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so... That's it? That's what you came up with? Really? [rocks in squeaky chair] stop. This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please. This is not a proportionate response. Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie. But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'? You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller? Nice basket. Oh. Did you shake it? Thanks. Got it. Ooh. Andy, no acappella. Oh, come on, guys. Please. It's not good. Goodnight, guys. Hey dummy, get in the car! Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car. Yeah, you can't. Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay? Good. [looking for Jim's sushi] Eel... eel. Hey. Who are you faxing so early in the morning? Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head] What you gonna do? You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job. Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would. Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that. Okay, yeah. Maybe I will. Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go. This is going to be an adventure. Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer? Hi. Karen. I love your sweater. Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn... ...to knit. Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian? [recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. [recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. [recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza. Mm-hm. [recording phone message] Karen Filippelli. Uh, what's that smell? Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home. Oh, you know. Never... .never mind. I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume. It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells. Who's Bob Vance? Shouldn't we be equals? Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration? How are we going to get home? Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration. [off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy. Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink. Yeah. Ok. Hey, nice thermos. Yeah. Uh no, I'm fine, thank you. Yeah, I'm okay, thanks. Hey. ...Almost done? Hey I got one. Jesus. You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow. Hey. What is going on? I love it. I want in. Who's the target? Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment. Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter? Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement]. Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ... A Christmas drinking game ... What? You're kidding. Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go. Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..? Right. Oh cool, yeah. Oh, thank you. Yeah, we do a raffle... What's your funding? Umm, two hundred and one dollars. Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three. And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five. I think that's a really good option... He's cute. You should date him. Yup. [Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo. Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.] Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What? Hey, so what's the status. Oh, you're kidding me? Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs] [Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift] Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices] Do you like it? Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas. Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties. Yeah, thanks. OK. No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD] And now we get to remember it forever. Thank you. [Both hug] We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating. Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment. Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo? Nope. I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away. What are the ingredients of poi? You sure? I think I owe you one. For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing. Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously. Oh, uh, thanks. Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins? Let's go get a broom. Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon? Yeah, thank you. Thanks. That was fun. Thank you. That's nice. Hey, do you want to grab a coffee? Yeah. You ready Jim? So, let me ask you a question. Did you ever have a thing for Pam? I moved here from Connecticut... Kay. What happened on your sales call? Hey. Yeah, you should not encourage him. Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't. [sighs] Do you still have feelings for her? I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever. Karen Fillipelli.  Jim's girlfriend. Yep. That's rude. Mr. Franklin? Do you have a girlfriend? Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth! So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use? Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys. Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him? Really? Okay. So um, well good. What are you sorry about? What are you sorry about? A toaster. Yeah. P and R? Ah, of course. [sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every... Oh my God! Oh, what happened? But Jim, this garlic bread is cold. Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted. What glare? [Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen] I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management. Rachel, your house is beautiful. Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall? That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date. And it didn't end well. Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated. Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable. Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me. I so got you. Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first. Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun. Hey Jan. I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael. See ya Pam. So do you want to see it or not? Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic. Yeah. Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend. Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up. ...and we're gonna go to dinner. And then we're gonna go to the movies. [shrieks] Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet? I feel great, Kevin.  Thank you. Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared. Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry. And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt. When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more. Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks. Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip. Fifty-one. It's a strategy! Thank you. I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out. That's three times in ten minutes. Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time. Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp. No. I'm good.  Thanks. Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous. Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting. Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect. What you're saying is extremely misogynistic. I'm saying that you're being sexist. That - it's the same thing. Can we just get back to work? Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that. It's a pretty common one. That is not healthy behavior. OK, OK. Um, cons. Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes. Phyllis. What do you think? Too much? Answer it. OK, remember, be strong. Hole? [lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh] Get 'em big boy! C'mon, Jim! Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well. As well. Yes. uh, huh. That would be fine. [whispering] Cut it out! Hey. It's okay, we all say things without thinking. [confused] Oh. Okay. Pam is... kind of a bitch. Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit. [looks annoyed] Heh. Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving? Oh. Cause of Jan again? Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow? Thanks. Thanks. [looks suspicious] Do you want to get back together with her? Do it. [moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that? Wow! I know! All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck! [Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview. Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house. No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me. Cause I'm going to get the job. So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first? How often do you come here? I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim. That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was] So what's going to happen to us when I get this job? Well, Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there. Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks. So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows? Yeah? He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now. He would be disaster. Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction. Don't!  She's nuts! [they laugh] Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so... Just call me when you're done. Good luck, Halpert. Yeah. Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton? I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else. Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye. Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay? [on phone] Hello? Michael... Listen, I- I'm- You called me. I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him. Toby's not a salesperson. Oooh.  Good-bye Michael. Jim? Uh, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good. Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted? I'm taking Stanley. Jim, hang on a second? So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh? If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult. [huffs] Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you. Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm. Hey. Hi, guys. What! Of course not! Let's just get this over with, shall we? Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about? But now we think you're a liar. Uh, it's very insulting. Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over. Can I please see you in my office, please? No that's, that is incredibly dangerous. You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team. Uh, in about a month. Thank you. It just all happened so fast. Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me. His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky. Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that? Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky. So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim? That's so great. That's great. Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam] How's Jim? Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!",ISTJ,Si,Te
Kelly,"I have a customer meeting. I just had the longest meeting. Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse] Uh, thank you. It was you. Yeah, it was. [laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall. Spicy Curry', what's that mean? Yeah, but why'd you give it to me? This is a bowler- Yeah, but everyone else- I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid. No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time. I'm okay! Let go of me! Definitely, definitely, Jim. How about you Pam? Why is that? Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer? Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything. Hi-yah! Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight. What? Are you going to happy hour later? Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs] You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense. I thought you read these every week. I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about. Good one, Kev. Oh, good, that was from me. [unwrapping the poster] Yikes. That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen. I will steal the iPod. Damn it. Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories. Hey. I don't know. So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea. I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one. Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway. Mmm-hmm. Sorry? Wait, Michael? Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit? Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit. I took the tags off already. Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag. Definitely some place you can swim. Did you hear something? Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia. Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid? Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair? You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry. Pam? Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam? Are you moving back here? Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy. [shaking head] Weird. [to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit... [to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones... Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me? Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him [to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30. [to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows? You just asked a girl out on the phone! That looks, cool, where is that? That hotel, it looks so romantic. I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually. I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan. I want an SUV... with three rows of seats. Oh, me too. What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal? I mean that's a baseball term, right? [in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you. [in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term... You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael. How can someone so beautiful be so sad? Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome. And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say. So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that? Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed. Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe. So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend. I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever. [to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or... I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So... OK, That's cool. I completely understand. It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together. Yeah, it would be so great if he was. Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves] Is Brad okay? This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston. Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception? But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married? Oh. Yep. [spreads tablecloth] Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela? God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies! ...that I thought you should know ... I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa] Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up] So, how's your day been? Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut. Second opinion on what? Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's. Don't be scared! You're good! You're good! And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way. Six. So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of... We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no] So, I was looking so hot... Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold. But then we wouldn't have any meetings. Okay. Bye, Toby. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay. I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking. To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn. Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you. Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing? You look so pretty. Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power. My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight. Alan's cartoon is so funny, right? And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time. So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day. You love ketchup! He loves ketchup. [gasps] I love it! You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on. Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch! [clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch! It's What? No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel. Isn't that like your third soda today? Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad. Ugh, no that thing is [crying] I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight? You told us we had to. Because they acted all tough and everything... But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to... I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be? Oh my God, I'm so worried. I don't know. Dwight's so weird. No, he's a freak. Here you go. It's not a dress. It's a kurta. You look so handsome. I know. I... I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends. Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right? Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um... Sparkles... Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think. Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that. Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys. Don't even listen to them. They're so... I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at! Uh... excuse me. I want to get a... Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know? Like, an Indian Halloween? Um, customer service. What? I'm not Muslim! She's so wonderful. If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one. Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife! Jim! Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you! Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing! I just told you. Looks like salmon. I eat beef. [pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun. What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink] See, I told you. You want one Meredith? Well that blows. [singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan... Hello, Ryan. Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends? Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore. [runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan] [from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD. I don't understand. [starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me. Sometimes. [crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks] Who's eating all these apples? And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks? Do you think I should diet? No, I'm scared. Uh huh. Hold me. I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers. Eighty-six. Eighty-seven. [singing] Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine. Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up] Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot? Do what?  I just asked you a question. Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam. Could you scoot over? You're on my dress. I know but there was an emergency. I look Are you all right? This must be so awful for you. Well... this was supposed to be your wedding. There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant. I can't believe you're back together with Roy! Oh my God. You're so in love now. Oh, art show! ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure. What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat. Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family! AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God... I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't... Hope she's OK. You prayed for this? Oh my God, when is it? I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going. I hear whispering. [still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to? That is the bravest thing I have ever heard. I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed. Oh it was? Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night... ...and you call me, to calm you down... ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not. I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you! You are so mean. Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid. What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher? Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor. Oh, so I'm crazy now? And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!' You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams... Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds. Ryan? What?! Are you kidding me? So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back You're such a ditz. Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible? You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot. Screw you. Give me that thing, I want to try. I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable. This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap] I know, right?  Probably a lot. OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation! [in accent] Absolutely! [in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend. OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing Ask where he's from. OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry. And you're sorry. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer. Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause. The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense? Okay, role-playing time! Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better? Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother. Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela. Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry. Do you think I'm a slut? Apology accepted! [hugs Angela] We're like best friends now! I'll text you! Bye, Angela! That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump. Thanks, Michael. Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome. [bang] Whoa. Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right? Hey, what's going on? [Screams] [sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye. I don't want to hit the big rock! I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it. [takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it... Can I have a turkey burger? Can we just take those first two things? Team U.S.A.! Who's Bob Hope? Oh, like Amanda Bynes. She's from 'What a Girl Wants.' Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam. Who was that? What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera] Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward. But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone. Pam, he's just not that into you. No, seriously Pam, wake up. She looks awful. That's Buddhist. No. If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now. Have a seat, I'll write it down. I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office. [from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away! [reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today? Oh. Can we speak privately about our relationship? Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys. A lot. Black guys mostly. What?! I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want. Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me. Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant. [shaking head] And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it. Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby? We have a date! You know, some place romantic and expensive. You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit] I don't understand what the big deal is. No! Right, so? No! Why not? Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps. Oh, he's also super-insecure about his height. And he doesn't care about anybody but himself. And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time. If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody? Waaay too tight. Why is it so tight? Depends... how much have you eaten already today? You had carbs?  That's awful. But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.' Thanks. Not so much anymore. Is that traffic school? Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work. Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate. Just reiterating what you said to me. You're so funny. I invited him. Okay. [makes out with Darryl] Umm, see you later tonight. Okay, bye honey. Ryan used me an object. What do you mean you have plans tonight? Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me. Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops. [makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat] Well, I just need to know where this is going. Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire--- Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that? Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding] What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong? Guess whose boyfriend it is? I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim]. I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there. [flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball. [flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon. [flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong? [Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point. Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong! What? OK. Bring it on. Think you can handle this? OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves] O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] Hi, Michael. Yeah, what are you doing here? Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna... Oh, my God... She's 23. Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with! Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with. If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself. Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you? Now he's never gonna come. Was he still there? I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim. Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good... Why would he say that? Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching. Ignore her, those glasses are so cool. Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time. Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office. Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama! I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel? I feel weird. I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.' Can I be your bridesmaid? Just leave me alone! [sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing. I was on an IV for two days at the hospital. It's just some of us are taking this really seriously. I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico. Oh, hello Ryan.  You look well. Cool. Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so... It's a small office. ...what else do people like? I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me! Nope. [to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet. What'd you say h[bleep]? Oh yeah, she loves that headband. She manipulates you. I never know when you're kidding. What? Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care. Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer. And this is way worse than the stroller she came with. Um, so you're in the tub with everything? [dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween. Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City. Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine? Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King? Oh, from the insurance commercials! So, you're dumping Michael? Smart. Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic! [enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress. Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white. Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking] So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100. Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael] Oh, my God. You scared me. What are you talking about? You always say that, and I almost never know. Are you accusing me of something? You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews. Dwight, get out of my nook! Yeah, he's weird. OK. Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye. What's going on? Nothing's going on. What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this. I love your tie, Michael. I was raped. OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends. See? I wasn't lying. I was lying. No problem. For you.  I'm with Darryl. Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups] [talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed. [making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong. Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again. Yeah. I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just--- Oh my God.  He's going to kill us. Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'. That's all he wrote. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm... We're back together again baby. They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny. Oh! Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby. Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now. Mmhmm. Punch him, Toby! Hi, Michael. Can't do what? Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you. Oh, can I come? So you're dumping me? Okay? Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you. Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag. I guess people have fewer choices as they get older. There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing? Yeah, shut up Kevin. No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears] Dwight! A vacation. I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael. Screw you. Oh yeah? Screw you too. My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl. Screw you guys. You're dead to me. Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that. I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again. In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it. Ice Cream. Stop yelling at me! I didn't do anything! I was kickin' it. My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday! You did? I wanna see the cake. I hate it. Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly! I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?! Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out] [enters conference room] This doesn't look good. [shakes her head no] You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake? Cool. I love it. You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap. [giggles] Thank you. I'm too excited to sleep. So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too. Decorating. Yeah, thanks. Well, his heart was in the right place. You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic. Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale. She could be. Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly] Michael, it's time. My god, he's like a black George Clooney. Thank you. Should I seduce him? I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys. I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight. What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way] Hey! Is that his scarf? Michael get to the good part. So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians.. Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door] Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just... So you should be heading back to your desk. She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year. Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton? So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could... And... Yes? Charles, you wanted me? Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me? Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it! Hey, guys. Hi. [mumbles]",ESFP,Se,Fi
Kevin,"Yeah, it'll be you. I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band. I remember. Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess. It was kind of hard to hear. Hey. You wanna go to the beach? You wanna get high? I think you do, mon. [Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti. He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom. What are you guys talking about? That's a real thing. Someone has it. Do you think we should go ? What is he doing? Italian. Yeah. Their bread's really good. I have a hoop in my driveway. I can't work Saturday. I'm in a band. It's a Steve Miller Tribute Band. So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around? She's prettier than you though. [nods] What is your type? Stay away from my mom. Do you like Steve Miller? Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band. [to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab. I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping. So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year. I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance. MILF! She wasn't that hot. Phyllis? Packer said it. You mean where my desk is? Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway. [Email chiming] [snickers] Did you see that? You can see her... How do you know? [paper football lands on desk] Ooh. Or when we're bored. We're bored a lot. Oh! We call it Hate Ball. Because of how much Angela hates it. Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?' It smells like cookies. [empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth] All right. Yes, thank you. Please... Please, please. Please. Present company excluded? Pam. What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him. [clears his throat] Was it worth it? Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three. Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day. Really? I would love that. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Stacy. Sweep the leg. Later Jim.

Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down. Hey, Kelly; I called him Fire Guy. Yeah... hey Stanley- It never gets old. [holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big? But what are we going to do with this hacked off part? Do we have one? I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily]. Should we just keep opening up the presents? I want the foot bath. That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot. Kevin Malone. [listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh. Mine. Thanks for the party, Michael. [Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man [singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah. I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party. Can you hop? I think that's from Big. What does that mean? The thing you just said? Whhh... What are you guys doing? Michael is that a wig? No. Jim has got it bad for Pam. Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding? Nice... she is What's goin' on? [taking a look] I don't think that's vomit. Me? Oh, that's ridiculous. Michael. [tapping on door] [pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long. It smelled There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs] [talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up. I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it. [blows a sigh of relief] That sucks so much. Woah. [Delivery man with flowers] Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear] Man, that thing's bigger than I am. Oh zip it. Whose it from? [to Oscar] Not really, my fiance is out of town. I'm not sure.

Stacy's back. You should go to Hedonism. It's like Club Med, but everything is naked. I've never, ever seen you take a sick day. I always set it at 69. [snickers] This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's. Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check. Go ahead. What're you doing? You never have plans. Niiice. [whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today? Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today? No. I'm still waiting. They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion. Um, I might have skin cancer. Right. Hello? Hey. No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy. Still scary. Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine. If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy. I can't relax about it, you know? No, not yet. Okay, Michael. Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative. This is awesome. Thanks, you guys. Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away] [nods] Hey... [giggling] That is so good, Michael I'm not taking Rogaine. I'd like a magazine. I'd still like one. Nice. So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet? Cause I'm in a band. We really rock. I accept your decision! No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah. Morning. Something with animals. Or people. We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band. Come on, Dwight. Yes. Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go. Yeah, I think she's full of it. Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen. I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker. All-in. Three queens. I suck. I do not want to talk about it. Yeah? Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay? Dude, you will not be sorry. All right. : That sounds great. So did you hear? Pam's back on the market again. If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that. Yes! Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year... Do you have any savings? Michael, you might lose your condo. Nnnnice. Wow! Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so... Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny. ...ces. [chuckles] Nothing. May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him. No. [chuckles] Not really. No. My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition. [Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey! Account...? Michael, what is going on? Night, Pam. [in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot. Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight? Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going? She looks like Pam from the neck down. This is the best meeting we've ever had. Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you. Nice outfit. For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band. No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage. Excellent. Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut. Where are we going? How about Cugino's? How 'bout Cooper's then? But, I don't want to go to DJ's. Hooters? Yes! [hugs Angela] Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots. All right. Cool. [interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming? Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis. Michael, I didn't get a gift bag. Can I have your pencils? Oh, yes I can. In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need. This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot. The beef is poisoned? Staples. Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any. Hidden from [whisper] them. See you later, Jim. [to Angela] It's his first day back. [smiles] I like it. Kevin Malone. What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt] The Penguin. Okay, Penguin. [laughs] Michael, have you met the Penguin? Yeah. Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before. Well, thanks. I appreciate that. You know who I really like? That guy, Andy. Hmm. Andy. Hmm. Martin? Wait, why am I a racist? He is black... right? And... Yeah! I wonder what he did. Cool. I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day. You got outdoors time? Michael, why don't we get outdoors time? I would so rather be in prison. [knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have-- The tires look pretty worn. That's not fair. Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.] Then why are there two flyers? Right. I didn't see where it was. I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm... Don't push it. You've got to be kidding! [singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but... [singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know. Right. Dude, you should know. I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. Already sent it to you my friend. Jan. Hi Jan, you look... tan. Yeah. How was it? What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks] But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun. You look like you have the munchies. I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her. Oh, so you've been to a real luau. Yeah. Angela. That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them? Are you sure? It is a big deal. ... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal. How much did you win? I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night. Thanks, so sweet. Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation? Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left. Can I join too? Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild. Michael. [Mouths 'hi' at the stripper] [to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her? Riiight. The gym. [snickers] No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding. Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light. My tire blew out on the way here, Michael. I almost died. I... I went into this skid--- ...What? I almost died. Wow. [locks bat in break room] I... am a hero! Your name looks really nice. Is everything ok, Michael? Hey Pam. Oscar. Angela. Yeah. It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this. No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands] No, it is here. Good thing you didn't listen to me. Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come. Because of reasons... Are there carbs in vodka? Sup? Later, Jim. Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight. You're wearing a woman's suit? Who makes it? Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman? Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you. Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So... [as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out! Five bucks says it's over 50. Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored. [mouths] Damn... On what? Nice. Long johns?  A shaw? [Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten. That is lame. Oh, geeze. Damn it. That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you. No, constantly.  Like, for Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies. Here you go. [hands money] Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds. If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick? [pours the last of the coffee into his mug] I'm sorry. Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have. Are you going to beat me up? See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know. Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate? [in accent] 'ello, mate! [in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies. [on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am [thinks] Eleven. Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial. Oh, but you still said 'I'm sorry.' Still said it. Ooh, can I be a pirate? If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles] I'm guessing not. Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me. Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom? You aren't curious? Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy. [quietly] Yeah. I'm going in. [in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God. Yes. [in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often. You're in here. [all get up to leave] OK. I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted. [singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done. Are you going to try it? Angela, it is a million degrees. Why don't you go Michael? Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot. [Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey. What's different about you? You look worse. So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen? Pam is taller. Yes. She has bigger breasts, too. I think Karen has a prettier face. Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call. Yeah. Will do. Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York? What? Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo... I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers. Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits. [raises hand] Do we have to? [at the same time as Dwight] Trees. [at the same time as Dwight] Forest. Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar] Are you kidding me? Who's we, you and Jim? Oh, I bet Jim goes too. Oh, I bet you ask? I bet you were. What Whoa! [applauds] [Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste! Michael? You cannot make me run. It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it. You didn't run for me... ...when I thought I had skin cancer. No. I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes. Back off me. That seems early, even for her. That'd be DUI. I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke. I knew it! [rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] Fire! You weren't here for that. When he started the fire. Little old man boy. Bearded man boy. No way! Yeah, later dude. Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now? What does that mean? Tuna Tuna Tuna. And he can get any girl that he wants. Tuna. Check you later. Hi, Creed, what's up? What do you mean? Wha... Dude, you gotta believe. That was so awesome. Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party? Maybe you could just change the U into an A. Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo? No, no. Oscar, talk to him. Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage. We think it's a straight forward kidnapping. What's going on? We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end. Good pizza. Different stuff. I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out. I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage. Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor... In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza. The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you? Dammit. I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night. I don't know. I do gamble Michael. The mob. [shakes head no] Yeah, women be shoppin'. Shh. True, it's best to hide our money problems from women. I still do not have your reimbursement check. [waves] Hi. [looking at Oscar] Mama Bear! I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face] Michael, that was fun. Damn it! Damn it! [banging machine] Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break. Oh, I'll take 'em. You never call back. About what? Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts. [enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door] [sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed. [off screen] Hurts like hell. If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself. Nope. Stacy broke up with me. Not anymore. It's a bitter situation. No, thirty. Yes. Nice. Michael, please he-- We need to assemble the five families. We have to. The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean. [to Andy] I'm calling the meeting anyway. [nervously stuttering] I... have... things... We want our parking spaces back! W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and--- After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one. We did it. We got our spaces back. Later. Way to go, man. Oh God. Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom. Michael you could put your initials in it. Hey Pam, I really like your glasses. All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses. Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually... Like librarians. Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'? Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him. [chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it! What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What? I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent. Andy, you're up, let's go! Yeah. Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy! Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty. Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals] I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole. He's not my client. Hi. I do the numbers. Do you want a M&M? Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them. Yeah. Hi. I can't decide what to get. Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips. Hmm... I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me. [everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house! Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car? Okay, bye. Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here. No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see. Just hurry. [hangs up] It was great to see you, Jan. Yeah, Michael, I just uh... I think you kids have a lot to catch up on. Yeah. I'll go to the diner with you. Yeah, we can go eat pie. Me too. Pam, you weigh 226 pounds? Yeah. Hi Jan. How's the candle game? Cool. Thank God they found her, too. Hey! Thank you, Holly. Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded? Oh, my God! [spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What? Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan] Yeah. You too. Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump. I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one? Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.' It's a trap. I think we're out. I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash. Wait, what? You knocked the mirror off of my car. Yeah. Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you? No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too? But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror? It was like two hundred dollars. Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles] But Phyllis, it's not his baby. Michael, the baby's already been born. So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them. OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born? Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom? Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank? I donated sperm. Maybe I'm the father. Next to the IHOP? [to camera] I might have done it with Jan! Jan?  What's new? Seriously?  You're okay with that? Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector. Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges. Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes. Federal and State. Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand] [also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four! Well, Hol, this is it. [outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies] [whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look] Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild. Michael, did you tell your mom yet? You love your mom. T minus... You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats. [with mouth full] Yes. So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in? Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay. Michael's a genius. Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912? Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon? Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool. Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith. Whoo-hoo! Hot tamales. Uh oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away. Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What? How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?' We're not listening. Oh come on, man! Believe in something. [most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all. She looks like a monster. That is not the question. Yeah, thank you Phyllis. [counting votes] Five. Five to five. So what do we do now? The debate is whether she is hot. Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting. Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture. He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing. [Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game. Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy. [surprised] Wait, what? This is ridiculous. It's out in the hall. [giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever. Call it. I would want to live with no legs. Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out. [giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God... [in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles] I'm almost done. I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch. It... yeah. Wait, you didn't give it back? Any cat, you mean. Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying] Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer] [gasps] That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady! No way. Oh, the other one's watching. [snickers] This is getting weird. Ohhh... I was looking at pictures of food on my computer. Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each? Oh, then pick TV. No, watching TV at work is really cool. [holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs] I miss Stacy. I can't even imagine. Was he in to you in like a gay way? A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised] My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done. Hello. I'm from here! Thank you, Michael. At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool. I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected] I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast. Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is. Are you on email? Cool. Bye. Good Valentine's. I think I should call her. Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today? But I do like her just the way she is. Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker. You guys are throwing a lot at me. Right. [puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that? Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking. I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie. Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes] Ni- Hey! Michael? I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it. Ok. That he's wasted 15 years of your life? Michael is that scotch? Pam? When will the new copier be ready? You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today. Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks. Sometimes. [dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh! I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there. I think he's singing. Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith? But you didn't want to start with us? Phones? Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom! Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call. Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it. Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer. Oh, man! Hold it. [on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings] [running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call! Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings] Wag. I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name? Try it in another sentence. I guess I could be nicer. Hi. At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.",ISFP,Fi,Se
Meredith,"Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo? Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered. A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina. Oh! Surprise. Yes. Uh, I can't. Um... I can't eat dairy. Yeah, it makes me sick. Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.' That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.' This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.' No, I... I get it. It's funny. You're right. You're right. Yes. I hate that. Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.' No, I...I get it. It's funny. You're right. You're right. Yes. You're talking about my hysterectomy. Um... what about office romance? Wow! Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County... ...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene... ...Jim. Is there anybody else. I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe. I'll take the teapot. Damn it. I really want the iPod. I'll take the oven mitt. We can drink? Me. Please. The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Damn it. Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade? All right! Me. Wow! You can take my van! Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations. In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober. Four and a half. Oh, that's part of my dream too. Slip. Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.' Yeah. Wow. Thanks. Please don't tell a sailor joke. Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order. I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter. Did you hear anything yet? Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh. Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free. Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed] Wow. Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with. Oh, right. [shocked expression] Why are all the best-looking single men always gay? That town smells like cheese steaks. I have a lot of work to do. Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place? Oh, that's what they call it. Hey, champagne. Where'd you get that salad? [notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny. [holds out flask] Do you want a little? Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay? That's cool. That was in your way? Sorry. [takes mug] Yes. [raises hand] I want to. [to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake. What was your cell like? Yes. Is that a threat? No thanks. They're too sweet. When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world. [to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck! Gerty's. I don't remember. SHUT UP ANGELA! Wait, this is the entertainment? I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding. I really want to come out! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh! Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding? You ready? Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding? Grow up. Get over yourself. Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs] [still laughing] I know. [comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom] [Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out. Hey Yeah.  Jack, these are my co-workers. I don't remember doing that. Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window] My car, my rules. It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot. [tires screeching] Crap. Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely [eating hot dog] What is it? [Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell? Um, I forgot my... Can we please pull over at the next rest stop? Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed] Hotdogs are really unhealthy. You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot. Turn around. Yes. Do it! You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front. At the same time. This is weird. No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in. Thanks. No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers. I have no idea. Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office. Michael, I'm not gonna do that. You cracked my pelvis You're not forgiven. [screams] Don't pull any plugs. Better. Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head. And a rat. Separate occasions. Hey Michael. Better. I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore. Sure. Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee. See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills] Oh please, Michael. You're gonna be here a Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you. There's nothing in here. Hey... there he is. I never thanked you for coming to the hospital. Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut. Anyway, I have this Sharpie... And I was wondering if you could sign my cast? [lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it? [whispers] I'll read this when I get home. Three hundred and five. Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty. Four-oh-two. What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve. I think it looks good. Angela, what kind of music? How am I supposed to know what that is? I can't believe he has a second job. I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around. You comin'? Piss or get off the pot! [slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up. I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen. Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake? I really prefer devils food cake. Yes! What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them? Don't patronize me. Owww! Hi, Pam. Guys, do we have to stay all day? Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car] Thanks for bringing that up. Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird. One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture] It's a couple streets over. Sure!  That sounds fun! I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears] Pretend?  Or really make one? Make your own [bleep]in' sandwich. What should we do with all these leftovers? I like her nails. I like her fingernails. Nothing. Who gives a f[bleep]? One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God... These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything. I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse. I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill? Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates. Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey? Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that. Am I in trouble here or something? Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms. Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity? Well... I'm not quitting. Don't sign anything. Am I getting fired? Hey, where is the steak sauce? I got some in my minivan somewhere. What are we gonna do? Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her? No.  Something I can blackmail her with. Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you? You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing. Hey, how did it go? Okay. [remains sitting] I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people. Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four? I wish Toby was still here. Ass...turd. You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home. Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted? [British accent] Hello. It's just a van. Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van. Pam failed art school. Come on. Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie. Yeh, they're rich. Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that. [drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again. [dancing drunkenly] Ahh yeah!! [continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing! I'm all right. I'm all right. A little better. I threw up. I'm not an alcoholic. I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic. Sure. Obviously. You're welcome. I am fine. I know I drink. I like to party I am not an alcoholic! I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn. We just missed Poor Richards. Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink? The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's... ...Brixx's, Carmen's... ...The Fort, Andy Gavin's. Well, it must have just opened up. Yeah... all right. Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah that's better. Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way! No way!  There is no way! No way! No way!  No way!  There is no way! No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there! I am not going in there! NO!! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait! [runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No! No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way! There is no way!  There is no way! No! No! This man is crazy! This man is crazy! No! No! No! No! No! NO!!! I knew something bad was gonna happen today. Yeah, my neighbor got murdered. I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder. I call loser! There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table. Hey, has anything happened yet? She's got mean eyes. She is an amazing actress. Chunky monkey. Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'... Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget. How much? Seven grand? I gotta see that little bitch. She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation. Awesome! Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed. Surprise! Take a nap! Surprise. [seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing? I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby. She could be your soul mate. Ok, what do you think? Did you spit in his face? Little Ms. Thing wants attention. I'll take them for my kid. [to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid. I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--",ESTP,Se,Ti
Michael,"All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library? So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? All right. Well, let me show you how it's done. [on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done. I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam? If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls] Any messages? Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate. It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face. People say I am the best boss. They go, 'God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious.' 'And you get the best out of us.' [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. Whassup! Whassup! Whass...up! [Strains, grunts] What? OK. All right. See you later. Back to work. Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah. Um... Me no get an agenda. I didn't get any agenda. Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning? Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it? Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes. Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you. OK... No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent. All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding! OK. No problem. Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing? Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it? Oh, that's not appropriate. Uh, I don't know what you mean. Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person. No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that. Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer. Hey. Guilty! Guilty as charged! Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German] Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect] Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise. I'm sorry? If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs] I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP. People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable. Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight. Assistant to the Regional Manager. I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody. You don't know what it is. [Laughs] I don't need your permission. Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. Not gonna happen. It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that. No. Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it. I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then. Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin. Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp. Introduce yourself. Be polite. Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. That's his profit. OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here? What is that? No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop. And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O. [Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round. Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores. Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do. So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to... Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first. Why? Well, theft and stealing. Post-it Notes. 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam. Yeah. I am. But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry. [Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you. I don't know about that. What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked. [holding up a Dundie and pretending it is talking] Hello. I'm Michael Scott. I'm the best boss in the world. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam? Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam. Messages? Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. [Michael and Ryan high five] Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. [camera cuts to Pam then back to Michael] Now, who was the one before Curly? Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita. Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Right. [Continues with cod German] Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler. [laughs] All these people are walking around and they're happy and their lives are just going along, ignorance is bliss. But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster. [imitating monster] 'I'm gonna get you, downsizing.' No. They wouldn't... They'd freak. And I'm not going to play God. They look to me for support. And they look to me for guidance and leadership. And I think if I could lie to them and it serves them, then that's what I'm going to do. So this is our sales staff. They are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money. [comes to a screeching halt and laughs] This is accounting. The numbers dudes. Do not let the job description fool you, they are all completely crazy. Especially that guy, he is a mental patient. [camera zooms in on Kevin] Not literally of course, that wouldn't work. The last place you'd want somebody like that is accounting. [hides behind office plant] 'Very interesting, but stupid.' Artie Johnson. It's a crazy place. What you don't know... Well, it can hurt you, but if you don't know it won't hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least. What's that? Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning. Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh... I check the jewels every month. This time... You know, it's a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So... What's, um... What you eating? Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later. Do I need to speak up? [grabs boom microphone] Hello. I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth. Hey, uh, can I help you out in here? Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea. Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited. Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man? Did you have a good weekend going there? Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar--- Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis! Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please? It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day. Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards! You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race. Exactly, were not... With tolerance. Ignorance. Let's celebrate. Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right? You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go. Yes. OK. Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him. OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr... Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that. How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black? I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off. OK, I will play guy listening. OK. Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer. OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid! [Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do! [As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie? [Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this. Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this? Sure. Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit. OK, well I know. You told me that several times. OK. Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't. I won't. Yeah, yeah. I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness...' Open-mindedness, is that even a word? '...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart.' I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, 'Mr. Brown,' he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears. All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good. Get out. No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape. [on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace. OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim? Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on. Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um... Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian. Two fifteenths. Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on. Oh, yeah... Wow. Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right? Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive? Well, it has certain connotations. Like... I don't... I don't know. No. Now, remember that honesty... ...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim! I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done. Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's... Oh this is a good one. Push it. Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on. No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that. Pam, come on. 'I like your food.' Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real. You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. 'Too soon for Arabs.' Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court. OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK. [Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you? Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!] [trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority. I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food. Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai. What? That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice. Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour. No, the country. Yeah, more like a 1,000. I just think that HERO? It's cute, but it's... It's empty, you know? It's easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind... Expectations.... Thank you. Sharing... And tolerance. Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word. I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally... No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally. Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that. Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside? Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. Doh! Hogan! Not again, Hogan! Get Col. Burkhalter on the phone! [laughing] I'm kind of a Hogan around here. And kind of, Jan is kind of Col. Burkhalter, then Dwight is Schultz. But, it's... Oh, God. We have fun. We have fun. 'Cause he's gonna be pissed. [making voice] No doubt about it. Are we going?  [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready. [mumbling] Should I... turn, no. Do it again. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one. Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton... Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one. Don't. Please don't say anything. [sighs] Oh, God. Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace. [wandering around the room during his diversity exercise] I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out. Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool. Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile] Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here? Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [Kelly slaps Michael] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Kelly thank you. [claps] She's not here, but she gets it. That's what we have been looking for. The whole time. [trying not to cry] Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It's like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right? What, huh? It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up. Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies. Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway. Lay them on me. What? That's not what you said earlier. The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist. I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works. I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan. Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good. You gotta crack these things open. Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice. Well, it's a suicide mission, you know. There, there... [scoffs] When have you ever done that? Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah. There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers. Yeah! Really? Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan. You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace. Nope, you cannot use it. Temporary workspace. You can use it. If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already. [on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks? Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there? Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call. I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce? Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this. Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check? Ah, what? Which memo? Is it a good plan? Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts? No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK? OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right? Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise. Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob. So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so... [on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride. Its says here that it's a 300ft drop. So it's not a free fall? Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something? OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway? Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism. Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly. There you go. Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it. [under his breath] Oh, Christ. Well, what? You could be referring to anything. Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits? Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday. Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is? All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr! When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles. [clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This... Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. Sorry, too busy can't even come to the door. Yeah, no... [hurries to get up from chair] You know what. I, um, I'm out the door. I'm going to a meeting. Pam, I'm headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go. Well, it is time to call in a little favor. A buddy of mine runs this tourist attraction, actually it's big. It's probably one of the most popular in the state. So... [on his cell phone] Hey, hey Craigers, my man! It is Michael Scott here. [silence] Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper. No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here's the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride. Well, it says here that it's a 300ft drop. So it's not a free fall? Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something? That's it? Uh, he's a small client. They don't really buy much. I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. [as Robin Williams] 'That's Good morning, Vietnam!' Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step [snaps his fingers] And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No. We're all going bowling! Oh! God. Dwight, come on... There's no downsizing. Assistant to the regional manager Dwight. Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay? But there's no downsizing, so just don't... Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe. It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, 'You're fired.' [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed.' It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed.'  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, 'You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want.' But that's unrealistic, so... Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person? Who is it? Who's the birthday? Next person on the... ...calendar. Yes! All right, come on down Meredith! Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise. Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up! [grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek. These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook! So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious. She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so... Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip? [to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, 'Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.' Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, 'Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael.' [pretends to vomit and laughs] [staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor. Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up? Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on? What? Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here. No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25. Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so... [looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath. Yeah. What do you know about Meredith? There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend. I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside. [laughs] Which one is that again? Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus? You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time. Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet. It's surprise Meredith. One, two... Find a key. And many more! You were surprised, weren't you? You looked freaked, man. We said 'Surprise.' You were, like, 'What?' 'What the hell's goin' on here?' Good cake. Why don't you have some? Come on. A little bit. Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good. You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good. Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal. Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time. Is Oscar around? I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so... I know... Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um... No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape? How many miles did he do last year? Son of a bitch. That is impressive. Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best. [under his breath] I don't know about that. [pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer. Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old. [laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... 'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right? Divorce. Um... OK, 'Meredith is so old...' Everybody? If... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...' She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.' That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me. This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that. OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25. Per mile, yes. When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back. A check for the kids, and for the team. I want it to be like... 'Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?' 'Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous.' 'Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott.'  'But it was anonymous, how do you know?' 'Because I'm him.' Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK? All righty then, well I see you're going for the whole bored supermodel thing. 'Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?' [takes a drag from an imaginary cigarette] Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke. No, no. I get it, I get it, I get it. A child is born, 'Oh, oh-hum.' A beautiful sunset, 'No, I'll catch the next one.' Right? Unicorn walks into the office, 'Oh, do you have an appointment?' [laughs] Okay, look Pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you're doing wrong. You are the voice of this company, right? And when clients call and you're not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff. Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile. Okay. [waits for call] I know, somebody will. And we'll wait. I know, I know, we will wait. We will wait for the call and you will smile.  Let me try something, just while we're waiting. Tell me if I'm smiling or not. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling? Okay, let me try this one. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you? I mean you can tell. I wasn't smiling that time and they can tell too. Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile. Show time! It's show time! Okay. Do a poem for Meredith's birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um, [knock on  door] there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin. No, not at all come on in. [Toby signing the birthday card] No, no. You can't. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so... I was going to put that in my message, Toby. All right? So just cross it off. Cross it off, now. [Toby writes on birthday card] What are you doing? Oh come on, you're ruining it. Toby, come on.  Just, look at that. That's wrecked. Ass. Get some white out. That's my white out. Get your own white out. Just... what's the matter with you? God. [Toby leaves] Okay, um, there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Who had a big, puttifflin. [thinking out loud] Mifflin, spifflin. Hey. Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith? There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend. I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside. Which one is that again? Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus? [sighs] Come up with a joke that I can use, okay? Help me out here. No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke. What? There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. [Dwight leaves] Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in. Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can't remember why I came over here. Ha, ha. I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. [makes fart noise] Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about? Just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, 'Brr, brr.' And I went, 'Argh, Argh.' You know? Anything? [shakes her head 'no'] Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy. Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn't actually have cerebral palsy. Okay. No, no. I know you didn't intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don't it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions. No, hey  it's just kinda uncool, okay? I, just... Play fair, you know, play fair. Thank you. Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old. [laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, Okay, here's a good one. Um...'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right? Divorce. Um... Okay, 'Meredith is so old...' If everybody... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...' She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.' [clears throat] What's the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson's surgery was unnecessary. Yes! Thank you. God. She gets it. [laughs] We just picked the best one right? Just had it. Um, no, no. Come on. No. Don't comfort... don't comfort her, that's not... She doesn't need comforting. We're just joking around. I think she's... No that's very unprofessional. I think she's being very unprofessional over there. [to Jim]: Hey, you ready? All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent. Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together. Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you. No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior. [to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game... [to Dwight] I vouched for you. I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar. Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that. Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager. No, it's not. It's lower, so... All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right. And here we have 'Mister Roger's Neighborhood.' Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs. And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs. No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs. [laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs. You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job!  Rapport! So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on. Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me. Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken] All right, see you at one. Are we ready for the game? I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings. Nerd. That is why you're not on the team. Uh, [in a nerdy voice] 'I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.' OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course. Um, what do you play? Center? Uh... Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that. Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time. [ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart. Yes. Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else? I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box. No. No, no, ridiculous. Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight. Sorry Phyllis. No, I'm team captain. No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager. No. Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now. Threat neutralized. [hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard! Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once? Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying. Oh, yeah right. Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good. Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man? Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face! Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday. What? OK. Cool, you're on. [to Dwight] Don't screw this up. [to camera] Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game. Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke.  OK, let's do it. All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch? OK. OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy. Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys. Aw, come on Dwight. On. Just put it on. Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK? Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! [Roy steals the ball, and goes for a lay up] Oh... Here we go! [Lonny shoots and makes it] Who's on him? Somebody get him! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [Shoots and misses] Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone! Who's got Roy? [Jim does a behind the back move around Roy for the basket] [misses a half court shot] Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. [Dwight scores] Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go. [Roy bumps Michael to get around him] OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul. OK, I'll take it. [misses free throw] OK. When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone. [misses another shot] What is wrong with me today?! Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually. Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim's pass] Whoa! That is cool. Is that like the Robot? [Ryan scores] Nice! Come here! [gives Ryan a chest bump] Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight! You know what? Dwight, Dwight... Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... [singing] Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah... [singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter... All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on! What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls. All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on. Shoot, shoot it.  [Roy hits Jim in the mouth with his elbow] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up. [Jim makes a shot after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt? [Jim pushes Roy to the ground and makes another shot] Yes! [Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys! Dwight! [Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score? Yeah, baby, here we go! [Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it! Foul! Foul! Oh, that hurts. What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason? No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there. [mocking voice] Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair. Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly. Thanks Dwight. Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won. It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face. Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so... Hey, hey... [laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word. Hey, what a game, huh? What a game. Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend. The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead. [slams palms on desk] Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you. Uh, yes. Thank you for noticing. Uh, they look that good? Wow. [Mike Myers voice] Oh, Pam please behave. Mike Myers, genius. Um, no actually I got them at a fancier place. Target. Uh... Yes, yes. Assistant to  the regional manager. No, it's not. It's lower. What was that? That look? Like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look. Okay, we're done. Is that your stomach? I keep hearing somebody's stomach. [whispers] God. So, you uh, see the Sixers game last night? [howls like a wolf] Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire! Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches. [makes 'pop' noise with his mouth] No, neither am I. We both look good. Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it's taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer. Answer over to The Question. The Answer, whew, [makes shooting motion] three points. The Question, whew, whew, [makes shooting motion] six points. Nothing but net. Question, who's the best player in the league? Answer, The Question. Or the Drunkmeister. Packer. Pac-man. Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots] I'm not your lover! I'm am not Michael Scott, I am Dr. Bergerstein. Your proctologist. Ah, yes. Ah. [laughs] It's not a Jewish joke, so don't worry. [clears throat] No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One 'o clock. Big game, big game. Mmm. No, you said you could man. We're counting on ya. You know you're playing point guard. No. Hey... I mean, although it's just for fun, you know we want... I was counting on you man. [misses a  free throw badly] I... I think you can play. Like you could when you were a kid. I think you can never give up the play. Because if people stop playing, then they stop living. It's like a shark. If a shark stops playing he stops living. And sharks are very playful creatures. You know what. I think most basketball movies are great movies. Because it's a great subject. There's one about a little kid who, um, joins a professional basketball team and he's really, really good and he can dunk and he's like 3 feet tall. And he can dunk the ball. That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don't like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops. [Michael's free throw is really short] Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there's a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He's uh, God what was his name? Um, he plays one of those curly horns, like those really shiny curly horns that's used in jazz a lot. Birdie. He's not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is... if you knew jazz, you'd know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is. [back to the basketball game] Dwight, pass it to Jim! Pass it to Ryan! Stanley, gotta play hurt. I just want you know, you've been a big disappointment to me today, okay. I'm in. I'm in. Here we go. [Lonny gets around Michael to score and he ends up in front of Phyllis] Zone, Phyllis! We're playing zone! Yes! Yes! All right. We got game! Affirmative. You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said... Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates! Okay Uh, huh. Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize? Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to... I didn't mean me! Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else. It's illegal. Can't do that.  Next best thing. Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid. Pam! Burger with cheese! And fries! And shake! What? Go ahead. No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction. Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away. [exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I'll talk to her. All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse. Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass? Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0. Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm  against violence in the workplace. Nobody cares what you think. So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day. Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman. I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating. This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall]  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be. So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here. Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks. It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here. Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded? Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right. [handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe. I have an idea.  Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right? Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please? Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right? You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy. Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that. I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here? I know, it's unbelievable. Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby. Toby, Katy. Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right? You and your wife, and you have kids. Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too? Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby's desk] Oh, she's cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work. I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike. Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  [to Katy] So how's that uh, coffee from earlier? Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys? Busted. Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones. Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers. Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you! Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper! [Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter? Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...? Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride. Seriously. No, really. God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp. I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves. What? Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five o'clock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home. Excellent. Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay. I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So.. No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto--- No, no, no it's not against the rules.  She's not a permanent employee so it's not. But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later. She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home. Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot... No. I cannot promise you that. Listen, Dwight. [laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away] Espresso? You're welcome. Thank you.  Hmmm-hmm-hmm. Ummm-hmmm... Very easy to clean. Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs] Did we get any mail? Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and... Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons? Ryan. Would you like to help me with a special project? Alright. [in Michael's car] Okay, just throw out all the empties. Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin. No. Uh, what flavor? Blue's not a flavor. Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you. What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir. No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it. Not it's not, there's some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out. That's over several months, Ryan. I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right?  I don't know. Sure you don't want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem. See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim. Where you going? With us? Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool. Alright, have fun. Don't drink and drive. Take it easy. You too, have a good night. Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning. Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that's it. Keep it in your pants. Well, don't do that. Where are your glasses? He wears glasses. Did you know that? Well, now suddenly he can see. [laughs] Okay, take off. See ya. Bye-bye. [gives coffee to Katy] There you go steaming hot cup of joe. Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. [laughs] Yeah, yeah he is the worst. What's the um, saying, 'once their laughing they're... that's... Once they're laughing that's 50 percent of them being horizontal. So, not that I'm just... Not that that's my... that's what I'm trying to do, but I think it helps kind of melts the ice. Breaks the ice, melts... Breaks the ice and melts them. Melts their hearts. Thank you, Al Gore... for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn't do that ten years ago? Right, but 20 years ago we couldn't and that is amazing. Here's Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy. [talking over Toby and Katy] Toby's divorced. God, that's hard. That really ripped you up. She got the kids right? That'll damage ya. Sorry man. That's uh, that's a bad one. How much you paying her? What can, you can't even afford anything now, right? You're all right though, right? Don't ask me for a raise. [laughs] Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do. Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car? Cause he slept in the car a couple times. Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man. Okay. I'll see you in a bit. [whispering] She's pretty cute isn't she? See you in a bit. All right. That's looking good. Hey um, Ryan do you have any music I can borrow. Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music. Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em. Mmm hmm. I like 'em. Yes. God. They're awesome. Uh huh. Yup. That last thing they did was great. Cool, so maybe hook me up  with some Fleebulls and some Hive. All right. This is gonna be good. Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, 'Hey, did you get an award?' And the neighbor will say, 'No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me.' Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So... [in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert. [in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert. So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera? Oh, that's a good idea. Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends. T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame. And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling. Oh, no you di-int. W-why did you... Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them. [in video] To Oscar Martinez it's the 'Show Me the Money' award! Yeah! [in video] He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight! [singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing... [in video]...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere... [on video] ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of... [talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton? Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home. Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So... Um... [to camera] Could you...? Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that. Um, what, ah, what is, I mean... ...come on, Jan! You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here. Well, yeah, I mean, what is... No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party... ...it happens once every billion years. Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N. Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage. This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. [puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. [tears open envelope and pulls out card] 'Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.'  Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk. [in video] The Dundie award for 'Longest Engagement' goes to Pam Beesley. Pam, everybody! [starts clapping] Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting. [on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf? [on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God! I'm not changing that, it's the best one. That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier. Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh. Yes. Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now. Just don't, don't talk- Don't talk- Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!! Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us. Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever. The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  You're just a name and number and no one even says hello.' [to Ryan] Card! You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-' Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink! Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks. I did. And why didn't ya Stanley? Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri. [to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight. No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy. And I was about to take her bra off... ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork- No! [under his breath] God. [clears throat] Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted. Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started. And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts... ...the 'Busiest Beaver' award goes to Phyllis Lapin. Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual. What? I told them busiest...idiots. Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that. [in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould. [doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny. Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout. This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office. Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The 'Hottest in the Office' award goes to... ...Ryan the temp! Yeah. [singing to music] 'Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you.' Here you go. And the 'Tight Ass' award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So...come on down. The 'Spicy Curry' award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go. Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke. I don't know, it's just... I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So... Just sit down Kelly. [sweaty and chugging water from a bottle] It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. [Music starts playing in the background] Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go. [Michael is singing to the tune of 'Tiny Dancer' by Elton John] 'You have won a tiny Dundie.' Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from? Oh, alright, yeah. Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh... [Something flies by Michael] Hey, you know, cool it guys, really- Let's cut it. [Dwight turns the music off] [clears throat] [with a lot less enthusiasm] I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened. [clears throat] This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the 'Don't Go in There After Me' award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So... [give Kevin his award]There you go. [getting his spirit back] Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year. You know you did. And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley... ...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year. It is the 'Whitest Sneakers' award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on! Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! [Pam grabs the microphone from him] Oh, here we go. Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. [Pam hugs Michael and gives him a quick peck on the cheek] Oh! Thank you. Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost. Great work tonight. Excellent. Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work. TMI. Too much information. I used to say, 'Don't go there,' but that is so lame now. Or, 'You go, girl.' Or... Um, when did 'Where's the beef?' That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, 'Too much information' probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years. All right, we need something for Kevin. What do we know about him? He's an accountant. [talking over Jim] He's fat. The fat accountant award. I am the fat accountant. Here he is. Really? What did they say? 'For a good time, call Michael Scott'? Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why... I mean, you just come in and you're just negative... ...and you just walk negatively. Do you want me to find out what it says? Yes. What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about? Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me. But don't tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me, I will say that you are crazy. Thank you. You won't regret this, Michael. I hadn't planned on including him. Kevin. Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies? Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character. Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me. [sighs] Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care? What? Dwight, you've hit a new low here. That is a good point. Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely. Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good. Here we go. [organizing his costumes] And that. [to waitress] Hey. How you doing? [singing] You down with the Dundies? [singing] You down with the Dundies? [singing] You down with the Dundies? You're all my homies [singing] You down with the Dundies? [singing] Yeah, all the homies I have listened to that song so many times and I still don't know what OPP stands for. Other people's... Something. I... [shakes head] All right, our next award... ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies' room wall, and the winner is... Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight. He's hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it? [sighing] It was unanimous, Toby. Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks. It's about you. It's about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it. Yes, it is true. Okay, I don't have time for this. I need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration. [imitating Native chant] Me Chief Michael Scott. Here to trade... Don't wanna forget that. Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's? Keep it. My gift. [hugs Chili's Manager] Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year. [clears throat] Hey, what's up? Any emails today? No? Um... Check your spam folder. What? [laughs uncontrollably] Kay. I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer. That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational. Um, I... Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey! Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah! Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him. Uh oh. Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o! Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So... Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why. Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one! Oh, yeah. Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there. Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it! Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button. Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um... Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise] Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything. Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. 'Old School'. Yes, Toby? Um... literally two seconds? Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family. No, no, Toby. No. It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on! What? NO! What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes? There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke. Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away. I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it. A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says 'Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?' This is what's at stake. Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got? Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense. Oooh, okay. That was still about me. What? I don't feel bad. No, I don't. Okay. Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys. Thank you. Hi, is it over? No. I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over. Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously? Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that? Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away? I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have. No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was? She would have definitely slept with me. Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin! What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line? What if they made out? In front of everybody? At home? And I told everybody everything about it. Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam? I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim? That's what she said. Pam? That's what she sai [clears throat]  Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay. Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure. So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes. Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em. When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another. The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything. Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan. No, I've seen the video. No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll] Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things. Mmmhmm. Yes. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [laughing] Come on. Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office] You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first. It's... That's... Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny. I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues. This guy does it all. What? So I'm not in trouble? I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems. Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so... I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in. No. No, no, no. That crosses the line. Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin. No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother. I don't know about that. Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner. Yes, your corner. Go. Mmmhmmm. They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon!  Come on! Come on. Oooh! I'm not worried. You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody. Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to. Good morning, Pam. What's going on? What? I don't get what you mean. Well, you said I looked thin, so what does... Does that mean I'm like thin weird or thin handsome or... [laughing] Yes, well, of course. Of course. [laughing] Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that? No, but I'm saying hypothetically if we were dating... Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out. You say yes, and we go out. And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby. Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, 'Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.' I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil. I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast. Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan. Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. 'Home Alone,' 'Risky Business.' Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do. Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs. Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate. Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you. Maybe. Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough. Sign the papers at the condo. Uh, I don't need one. I don't need a representative. No, No. No. Dwight. I'm fine. Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal. Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work. Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come. As my associate. No it is not. Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies. We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day. Very good. We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines? Good. The Small Business Man? Maxim? American Way? Cracked? How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly? NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked.  Thank you. Ok. See you soon. I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing? What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside.  Don't... please... I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner. I do not understand what you spend your money on. Home, sweet home. Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home. Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something. Nice to meet you too. Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um. Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that. This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall. I'm putting my bed right over here. Well, then I will get a warrantee. Well then I won't get a warrantee. So that's the problem, is solved. What? Uh... Ten year. What? Wha? You said ten. Ok, ok, ok. Alright. Ok. Alright. Oh boy. Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off? Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me. Oh, man. Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees] The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't... ...know if you showed me this same unit or not. Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles. As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here. There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down. No, no, no. I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin. Ehhhh.... I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun. There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today. No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent. Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities. I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone. What the hell is a terrarium? Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place. We take separate cars. Why would we do that? No. EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok. Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst. Nobody likes beets. Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet. Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm] Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on? Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly. You know. Really? What's this? I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment. Get up here, Dwight. Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem? Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that? Oh, okay. I'll tell you. Let's see here. Three bedroom, two bath... ...contemporary townhouse. Two car parking... ...wall-to-wall carpets... ...all fixtures included. Yes, this is... This is looking good. I think it does. Yes. I think it has a... Yeah, it has a deck. They call it a porch, but it has a deck. When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind. Was I well-loved? Check. Did I express myself? Did I let my light shine through? Check. Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral? Check. Probably more than one. Check. Check, check, check, check. Lastly, did I achieve success and own real estate? And when I close on this condo, I will be able to check that one as well. Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. [groans] Are we ready? Are we gonna do it? This is all mine. All the way down around the corner. It's a shared space, but I can use it whenever I want to, Ah, the volunteer Sheriff station. No. Oh, anything bad? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. No. I don't need a gun. Hello! How are you? I'm, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we're going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what's the vibe? What's the vibe of this place? Oh... That's gonna change. [laughing] Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place. Here's a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway. [Man steps back inside his house and shuts the front door] All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool. I think I'm going to make myself some microwave popcorn. [humming] Press 'Popcorn.' Oh, that's gonna be delicious. I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon. You know what? I could do with some hot chocolate as well. Oh, drat. I can't make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time, unless, I can. Boom! Second microwave for le hot chocolat. Oh, Carol. Hello, how are you? Good to see you. Second bedroom for the ladies. I mean, the extra ladies who aren't in my bed, or for friends or family, whoever wants to pop on by to casa de Scott. And right in here... What, what's in here? Uh-oh, bedroom number three. What are we gonna do in there? Limitless possibilities. What? [toilet flushing] What are you doing in there? Oh, my God. Dwight. You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids' room. I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna have kids. I'm not gonna date a 55-year-old woman. No, it's not. Just shut up. You're an ass. Shut it. No, you don't. I'm gonna back out of the deal. Nothing personal, but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here. This smells of fraud to me. This whole thing just kind of stinks. Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think. Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs] Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be? Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager? That is ridiculous. Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one. [speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is? Mmm... No. That was Yoda. There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play. And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch. [to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey! Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands. Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations. Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two. So what was rule two? Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower. Okay, uh, well, one is taken. Well, he needs a permanent number, right? Um, yeah.  Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges. Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it? Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh? Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for... ...for Phone. What? Um, oh, thinking about business school? Really? So you think you know a lot about business? Uh huh. Yeah. Quiz me. Come on, egghead. Let's do it. Quiz me up. Uh... When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me. [to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal. Okay. Yes! It was a trick question. Okay, Dwight. You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about. For instance, why don't you go to business... Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all. Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be? You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me. I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think? Nah, I'm okay. Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here? Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy? Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do? Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business. Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo... Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So... What's that? Yeah. Dwight. Hey! Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen. I didn't say it to him. I said it about him. [in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either. Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find. I gave it to you in the car. I saw you program it in. Okay. Alright. Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir... Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh. Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school. Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan? Toaster Oven 101? Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans. [singing] ...since the world was turning. Okay. Rule five - safety first,  i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer. Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart. I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow. Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule. Mmm-hmm. No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So... No. No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan. I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it. Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship. When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have. If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what? Even one is amazing. Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great! Ohh... OK. I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay. Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning. Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day. I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back. Okay... Sherri? If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you? Thanks. I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri. Okay! I'm sorry. No? Bye. I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about. Yes. Yes. Yeeesh. Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Because it's very scary stuff. You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here. No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be? And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail. I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around] Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody. Hey. You guys excited about the party? It's gonna be fun. [looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day. All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such? Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good? Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers. Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it. Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats. Bend It Like Beckham.' [laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect. Well, I don't really have two heads. So... Who do you think it should be? No, Jim brings in money. Eh. It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale. [turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who? You're right, I didn't even think of him. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. Yeah... I could. I'm not saying that's what he said. [listening to his head] What? That is not a very nice thing to say about him. Are you kidding? I agree. He'd land on his feet. So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it? Ahh, come on. I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away] Oh, God. Fantastic! What?! That would've solved all my problems. Oh, you idiot. If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody. Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back? You can call. Can you call 'em? Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God. [clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute? Help. Me. I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it. Yes. I want you to be me, and I will be Creed. No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head. Yes, that's a good idea. Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself! I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault! Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month. I... this is Creed. I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings] And I'm very angry, and I want... I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me. Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah. Uh, hey... Creed? Could I talk to you for a second? You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop. I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better. No, you wanna leave. Why... why are you making this so hard? I think you're right. No, of course  you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye. Hmm? What old days? What are you talking about? It's right here on the desk, yeah. I can't, I can't... I can't change anything. This is the way... I don't... okay, just listen. Don't... Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask? I have to fire someone today, okay? Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you. Don't... Devon, could I talk to you for a sec? Well, he... Well, maybe I did. Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot. No. No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and... I just hope that you and I can remain friends. Devon, wait, please. Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings. I  love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year. He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great. You look great! And you're a princess? A fairy princess. You're very... . You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these. Hey, you. Big Jim. And Phyllis. Working hard, Phyllis? Of course. You're always working hard. Keep it up. And there's Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do. No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything's great. Just keep living your lives. Everything's gonna be fine. [sighing] You are all such wonderful, innocent people. What? What? Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief. You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign? Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have. I'm going to have to do this Sopranos-style. Just whack him. Guys, could you take the freight elevator, please? You know what? That's my foot. You guys... I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct? I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building? Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready. All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. [elevator bell dings] Wow, that's  a fast elevator. I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah? Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him] Leave me alone, okay? Do you want some coffee? [slurping] Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed? Yeah, that's right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement. Why? It's just that you never got married and you live in an apartment. Yeah. Just trying to be your friend. Of course, I did. I always... Yes, I do. Are you pulling my leg or... You have no clue why I've asked you in here? Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal. Yes. Actually, I have. I have been on a hunting trip. I shot a deer in the leg. I had to... I had to hit him, I had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour, so he... That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask? His name was Devon. The human being man's name was Devon. [talking over Jan] Yes, yes, yes. Yes, it is. Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined. Do you? I don't think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me. [talking over Jan] You're glad? Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good? [talking over Jan] Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I'm gonna give myself a pat on the back. There. I'm doing it. Right there. Great. [camera pans over, Michael is sitting in a chair] Yeah, blah, blah, blah. You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved. [singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day. Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information. [to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin. Yes, thank you. I know where to sign. Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam? Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is. Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.' Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you. Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell? [in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland. This is Tito. Calling from... [Ryan hangs up] [Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up. [in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson. And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man. Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen. Because I would kick his ass. So? I've beaten up black belts. They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out. And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again. You were a Jet? Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link. I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up. Just hit me. You'll see. Oh, queer... [realizes he is on camera] eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it. Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass. Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'... ... he cried at the end of it. He did. Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid? Ok, here we go. Alright, come on. Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh! Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you. [Pam knocks on his door] Go away. I haven't signed them, ok? Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough. Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him. Oh, so that's what they are saying? Ok, alright, where is Dwight? Ok. Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you. No, Really? Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor. Really? You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now. No, they must have class. Look... Hey, Toby. I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools. I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll. I think it is. A guy told me about that. Oh. Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner. Hey! What the hell was that? No. Alright, that's the way you want it. Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man. I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him. I got his pants. Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! [Lots of yelling and flailing of arms by Michael and Dwight] Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya. You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie] Open your mouth. You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? 'Raging Bull.' Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn't pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we're playing phone tag. My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for? [knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya? He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man. [Knock at the door] Yeah. Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend? If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout. Alright, bye. Dwight? This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute? Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time. Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby. I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight. I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that? And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager. I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it. No, no, title change only. No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now. Absolutely but not really. Yes you do. And, ditto. I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo. Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about. I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die. No, that's not how I meant it. Shut up, Dwight. Yes. Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. [exclaiming] Oh, stretchin'. I like to stay tight. Compact. [Dwight screaming] Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black? God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting] Stan the man. Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually. I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him. I went medieval on his heinie. Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He... Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That's not how business works, okay? [sighs] Okay. [door opening] All right. Here you go, Princess. Just finished with part one. Yes, under my tutelage. If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now. Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today. I changed it.  To Chili's. Radisson just gives out this vibe, 'Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson'.  It's kind of snooty.  So. Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course.  It's where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine. It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor. Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip. Ok, let's do this thing.  [to Pam] Wish us luck. [under his breath] Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now. Well... No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we're gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn't matter, it's an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios! Uh, I'll drive. It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you? At all! You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de- Dar de dar. Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead. We should come up with a signal of some sort. Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal- Well, I... it could be either of us. Yeees. Hello?  Christian? Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould. No Gould? Uh, Jan, what happened? Is Gould dead?  What uh- Wow, you're kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about? When did this happen? Ok. Alright, after you. [mouths 'Wow' to the camera] Awesome blossom. [to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom? Ok, it's done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it's done. I heard a- Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it? Ok. Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo. Pam, it's Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me. Yes. No. Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one. Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning? First guy says 'Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn'.  And the second guy says, 'Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort'.  And the third guy says 'I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe'. [making the mouth on his tie talk]  Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs]  That's delicious!  I love it! Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop. That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words.  That's her fault. Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm? [singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs] [singing] Chili's baby back ribs... Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh. Oh, so you're not gonna play?  She's not playing. She's not playing the game. Check please. No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right? You know? It's true. Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It's home, you know?  I know the challenges this county's up against.  Here's the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don't care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices. It's bad. It, you know what, it really is. Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan? [waving to Christian]  See ya. We did it! Nailed it.  Nailed it!  Come here. What!? Goin'. Ok.  Where we goin'?  Doesn't matter.  Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok. Morning, Pam.  Hey. No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, I'm, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all.  It's off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So. Hello, Dwight. Who. Uh, no, no, no Gould. This is none of your affair because she is your boss- And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all? I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question: do I do it as the man?  Does she do it as my superior?  I don't know.  That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.  It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me.  Hello?  Hi!  Just talking about you.  The camera?  No.  Uh huh.  How's traffic?  I miss you.  What.  Ok.  Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.  No. [to camera]  Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm.  No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have.  Right.  No.  Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people.  Only other people.  Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.  I didn't slip you something! Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly? Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet.  It's, it's kind of unique.  It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese.  And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing.  You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers [shot of Michael peeling boiled egg] and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.  I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore.  Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg [Jenna breaks as Pam and laughs] I know, I know!  But you know what?  It's perfect.  I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?  Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing.  The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea. [throwing away food from the fridge] Not today, Kevin.  Cannot be around carbs today.  You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs? Uh huh. Conflict! I have a conflict with that. Uh, I have a pajama party.  At the Playboy Mansion.  With the bunnies. I can't get out of it! Ok, alright. I'm hearing you, meeting confirmed. Meeting confirmed.  Would you like your confirmation number?  Please grab a pen, because I will only be repeating this once. 42897.  Ok. What is a closer?  A closer is a sales term for someone who always gets the job done.  And that is me.  A B C, always be closing.  Glen Garry, Glen Ross.  'Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads.'  'No way, they're just for closers.'  'Do you know who you're talking to?' 'I'm Michael Scott.'  'Really?  Well, take any lead you want.'  'No thanks, I don't need 'em.'  Because I have a client list [taps screen] right here in my computer.  [sighs] So suck on that. Pam, could I see you in my office? Pam, you're trustworthy- And a woman- And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] 'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.  I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.'  First impressions? My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual. [playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me? But then she goes on to say 'that will be our only topic of discussion'.  That doesn't mean anything, those are just words. Ok. Yeah, what, what? Ohhh, great.  Well, now I'm in a terrible mood.  Let's do your performance review- Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that? Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, let's listen to that again. [plays Jan's message] 'Michael, it's Jan.  I guess I missed you'. Really? God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry. No kidding. Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn. Yeah? Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year. Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah? Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure? Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's. Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's. Oh. Been thinking about you. Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just- Yep. No. They are not.  Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up]  That's my girlfriend. Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A 'Michael-idea' folder? That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there. The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes? Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p. What did I say? Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K? Hi, Jan.  How are you? Good to see you. Ok. [tries to kiss Jan's hand] Ok, why don't we just step into my office?  We're gonna go in here. Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls. Alright [takes Jan's coat]. It's nice to see you. Really? Oh, well. Alright. Yep. Absolutely. I'm a little confused.  'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy.  And then it's like all regret.  Because 'Oh, I regret that.'  But, 'Wait, I'm still gonna call you.'  But, but, 'We're just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job.'  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business. No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I'm very fast.  I'm not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am.  But I do say thank ya ma'am.  But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam.  Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam.  If it's consensual.  [cold Jan stare]  We're talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question? This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise. Are you wearing a new perfume today? Well, you're wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy. I don't understand- [phone rings] Hold on.  Sorry. [answers]  Yes, Pam. I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt. I did not, not, not use those words. No, it's in like ten minutes. Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?' Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally. And, um, one down.  Next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression'.  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression. Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it? Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom. Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion. Arrr, dooby dooby do. 'You need to do something about your B.O.' Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody. Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words. Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we've learned this, let's continue.  See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.  'You need to do something about your coffee breath'- Ok. Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box. Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well- I'll work on that- Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow. Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion. Don't sl-', ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it- I don't understand why you're so upset. Let me ask you- Ok, let me ask you this. Let me ask you something. Where did you get your outfit? I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened. Look- Oh my God... What do you want Dwight? Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye. You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave. Why on earth would we give you a raise? You do?  How do you get in? That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart. Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that? That was deer!? Gross, oh! Oh, did not! What do you say, Jan? Ok. You just, uh, clear your head. That's from Superman? Wait. Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why? Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place? Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance? I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio? Am I too short? Really? I appreciate that, thank you. No, I wasn't, I didn't cry- So my looks have nothing to do with it? Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now. Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight? Never missed a day, my ass. Oscar, I'm ready for you. So... Um, you're in accounting... So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more. All right. Yup. Absolutely. I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask? Yes, it is. Yes, I did. Hell, yeah. Yeah. What? Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but... Um, yup, wait, yes. No, there... Later there was. Yes. I didn't, you know, it was... It was dark, for one thing. Let's just push on, shall we? It's next. Just keep it. 'Look on the supply shelf.' What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you? Okay, yeah. Okay. Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this? All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley? Christ Almighty. All right, next suggestion. Don't...' Okay, that's blank. Don't. Just... Well... Crystal. How pleasant. You can... Okay, I think we're good. Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband. Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get? Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did. Never... Well, then, Gould wasn't kidding. Nothing, I just... Nothing. No, I did not. Maybe I did. Maybe I  called him, I don't know. I... I didn't do that. I... Maybe he called me. Ex-husband, you have to let it go. What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot. It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  [sees man in a turban outside] Oh my God. Ohhh. [dials phone number] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here. [goes out onto office floor] Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend you're not here. There's no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door] The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start. Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected... Oh... Oh, umm... [looks at Post-It on computer] Yes. AH! Guh-oood. Please don't do that. I can't tell you. I don't have to tell you anything. Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That's strong! I'm not going get a brain- Stop it. Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don't you just go... away? There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails. So how do you search? Try 'profits'.  No! Try 'Michael Scott'.  'Michael' 'boss' and 'funny'. [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow!  [chuckles]  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.  [reads e-mail]  'Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.'  Well, Stanley's an ass.  Not one of our harder workers. Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I'm a robot? [robot voice]  I will destroy everything in my path- Beep! Bop! Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can. Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose. You know what the problem is? The problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother', they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother. Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jim's tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... .[scrolls down list] No. There's always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just nature's rule.  It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler. Of course.  Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup. Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody'd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors. Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them. Hey there. Almost quittin' time. One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out. You have plans. I do, too. I do, too. I do, yeah. Big plans. Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds- Yeah. It's the best.  It's the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go. It is. Ok. [someone coughs] What? Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport? Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with- Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to? Ok, alright. Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin' off to? Yeah, well duh.  Where ya headed? Liar! You are a liar. Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin' tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy. That's, whatever stupid show you want- To watch tonight We're watching it. I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight. You, too, Dwight? [In Horshack voice from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'] Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air. [fake kicks in door] Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  I'm with the FBI. Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun. [gasps]  That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't. Boom!  Freeze!  Michael Scoon, FBI.  You know what you did.  Boom! Boom! Boom! [shoots at Pregnant Girl and another actor]  Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you?  Didn't ya!?  Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds.  I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.  [another actor steps in]  Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Why Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going. Boring. I could of- Ok. Yehhhehh. I'm in. No, no, no.  I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune. What are you... [whispers to Bill] Nothing. Good, it's good.  Good work, everybody. So Bernie's, huh?  We're all going to Bernie's? [to camera]  Go to Bernie's? Right, right, right.  Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so...  Can't get out of it. Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not. Wow!  Who opened the morgue for this thing?  I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in.  [to Jim] There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it.  Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!  [sees Sadiq (IT guy)] Oh, come on! That guy?  He is a good guy, not a terrorist.  Karaoke, I love it!  I am a karaoke fiend.  I call dibs. I got next, I got next up.  Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok?  Where's that wine? Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.  [singing]  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin' on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can't explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind--- We're making love! Talk! Just talk! Shut up! Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv.  The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says 'Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.' [giggles]  And that was an improv.  Um, the real way is that I found a flyer. Um... Nope, nope.  I actually wear a turban sometimes.  Wanna see it? Got it right here. [pulls out Karnak turban] Comedy; it's funny.  It's Johnny Carson, Karnak.  It's, um, put it back.  Huhhhh, did you have Johnny Carson in your land? Oh. You were forbidden. Alright, I'm gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee.  Do you want some coffee er- Or some tea or hummus or something? Should have done this a long time ago.  Tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters.  Uh, uh huh.  Wow, like Kevin, rating the best bars in Scranton?  Poor Richard's number seven?  Idiot.  Stupid load.  [phone rings]  Yeah. Yeah, I'm busy right now. [hangs up] Here's a helpful suggestion for Jim.  Jim, instead of e-mailing Amazon, to try and get that CD that you didn't receive, I suggest that you go to Visa and tell them to cancel the charge. It's seems like ya did though- Jim.  Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space.  Alright, let's get back to work. [moves chair to Jim and Dwight's desks] Ooo, bleh bleh bleh. I don't know.  Just felt like taking it off.  Man, work can be just so damn frustrating don't ya think, Jim? I don't know, same old stuff.  Same old.  Boss just been ridin' my ass. I don't wanna talk about it.  I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys. That's not the point. Yeah. Ok. Ok yes, I would never do that. Ha. No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time.  This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it's what it's all about, just hangin' out.  Enjoying friends, all being the same.  Worker bees. No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around. I'm not a master bee. I'm just a bee, Dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'. Five o'clock.  Time to go get my improv on. [drinks]  Little bit of the comedy juice.  Mmm.  Alright, see if you can guess what this is. [roars and flails his arms]  That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class.  Just a taste of the improv. I need to know... who shot Johnson! Shut up! I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head. Just shut up!  I don't wanna hear anything more from you. Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!  No deal.  Not with Michael Scarn, FBI.  Michael Scarn doesn't make deals.  Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. [blows on his fake gun] She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story. Well, you kept- Going into nuclear something; that's not where the scene was going. Well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction. Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and that's, you should of just gone- Well... I don't think there's any stronger choice than being a really strong character. Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that's... Exactly, thank you. I appreciate that. Or Ryan Stiles, something like that. You shouldn't have been, 'cause you were dealing with Michael Scarn.  That was exactly what I was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that's a compliment. Good work. I'll just throw out some suggestions. They're in a whorehouse. And he's a proctologist. [to teacher] What? First sentence is: 'I'm a proctologist'. Alright, I'm ready here. Here we are. Oh god. No, no, turn it around. You'll break it. You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight. All right. Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh? On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three. Merry Christmas! Did it work? A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year. Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about. [comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting? Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me. It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that. I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive. Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody. No! No way! It... no. You wanna be Santa? Have you ever seen Santa? Okay. Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work. That makes sense because he has elfish features. You get something good this year? Yeah? Who did you have? I think I got something pretty nice for my guy. I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow. Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond. It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan. All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready? Not great. No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa. Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.' No, don't! Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away. You don't know that. I did? What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right? Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on. An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out] So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod. I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap. One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift. Well, I call it fun! Because it's better. Because it's more special. Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot. Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt. Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now. I think this is going great. Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle. Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn. [holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful. Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology. Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm. [opens present] 'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.' Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod? Last gift. Kevin. [after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about? Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets. Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me! It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000. Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame. All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered? Cool, cool. Box it up. Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty. This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze. Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink? Go, here we go! Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin] No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party. Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend. Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to. You're welcome. No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen! Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake. Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up. Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it. No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it. Hey, Merry Christmas. [coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening! Yeah, that sounds good. Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time. Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's? Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat? Okay! Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree. Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper. Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason. Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn. Oscar, paint ball pellets. Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. [Phyllis gets up and leaves the party] See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, 'Man, I wish I got that.' I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good. Hello, everyone. Ah! Ha ha ha! Yeah? Stanley! Bo banley. Banana fana fo fanley. Be my mo manley. Stanley. Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it? Maybe, I don't know. Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack. It's cheaper. This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience. It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise! No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan. Well, this... Yeah? To throw you off the scent. Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it. Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say. I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course. Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork! Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone? Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace. All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands! Titanic? No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on! No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse. The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship. [singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour. Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan. I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party. Okay. In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose. Hey, look! I'm king of the world! And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome! Okay! So... Right. But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight. I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna... Rock it! If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'! Yep. We're all gonna have a good time tonight! Hm? Okay. Yep. Having fun? Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers. Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support. So, okay. But before that, I have to do my presentation. All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate! Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing. Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save? No, no. Salesmen and profit centers. Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership. Okay. Not what I was looking for, but a good thought. I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you? Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great! Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin! Then I'll give you away! Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication. Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a... It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about. I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet. Is somebody there? Captain Jack has a problem with authority. He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic. Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged. Roy said the first one didn't count. Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan... Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute. Well, if you like her so much, don't give up. BFD. Engaged ain't married. Never, ever, ever give up. It's a fake wheel, dummy. [knocking] Yeah. Hello. Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah. Have a seat. Oh, every man's dream. Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it's a booze cruise, but it... There's more to the story than that. It... Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme... Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat. Of course. Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people's lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat. Hello. Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That's... You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone? Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone? Thanks. Oh, okay. I'll see you later. I'll call you later. That's like... I'll call you, too. [to Brenda] So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine. What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think? I'm not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And... No, I'm first mate. You're second mate. I'm first mate, as the captain. Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well... [to Brenda] Tell you about Toby later, he's awful. Oh, hey, Toby. So... It's an analogy. [Toby running to get on the cruise] Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat. Idiot. No, no, no. That's his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor! Your problem now, Captain Jack. Hey. You know what the best way of studying is? Flash cards. You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here. That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay? [playing badly] Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb. [feedback echoing] Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead. [playing Smoke on the Water] Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What? You know what? I don't think it's in... That's not in tune. I don't know if you can... ...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend. Good luck. Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old. Yeah! Toast! That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... [band starts playing] Hey, Jim. You got a hat? Thanks. Pam! It's Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now. I'm hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God! Ungh, this is not looking good Pam! No, I want you to pick me up. I am hurt. I hurt my foot. I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone] OH GOD! Oh God! OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work. I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, it's good for me.  It's the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it.  I don't see what's so hard to believe about that. Pam, could you come get me?! Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan? There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that? I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance. [panicked] No one wants to pick me up!? I'm not sick! I'm burned! Don't... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight. I don't want Dwight! I don't have a girlfriend. It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight. Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight! Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through. Did you explain why? Burned my foot, Pam. Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you. Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping... Thank you.  Pam, messages please? Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and... No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God! What? I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don't think that's too much to ask. No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy.  Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing.  I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot. What?  Part of your duties are to what? You just said 'part of your duties are to' something. Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you? Where is my cornbread? Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like? Where are the yams? Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg? And they had no yams? How strange.  Because they always have yams. Pam... PAAAM!? Come here please. I want you to rub butter on my foot. Pam, please?  I have Country Crock. Uh, ow.  Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN! No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I'm not gonna call Jan.  She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you? [loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me! I fell off the toilet.  I'm caught between the toilet and the wall. Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam. Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel. No, he's not. I just saw him. Ugh, forget it.  I'll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God! Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar? No, never heard of it.  No, a Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles. Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?! Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me. [sigh] I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there! While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society. Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]: AIDS. I don't think so, no. He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here? What you mean uh hmmm... ? Ok. Yes, right in here, come on in. This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest. You are so brave. You are so brave. But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair. Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning? Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me. How did you get in your wheelchair? Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny. Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor. Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it? Ok... Ignore him.  You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick... Yeah... Ok. Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy. [popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey! You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan. Did you get the yams? [sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding. Yeh. You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot. Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better.  My body's literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain. Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins. Oh, now you feel some compassion for him. Why don't you go with him? I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity. Oh, ok, that's, great.  No, I can't drive.  Jim why don't you drive. We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please. Shotgun! The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion. Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith's problem? Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She's not gonna find one driving this thing around. Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese. I know, just sayin'. Dwight, what are you drinking? Give it to me. Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight]  Give me the bottle or you're fired. Give it to me Dwight. Give me the bottle!! Gimme the bottle, Dwight! Just give it! Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle! Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle! Dwight, what is your middle name. [sigh] Something with a 'K'. What do I write under 'reason for visit'? Nothing.  I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'. No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim] Hi Dwight. Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury? Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly. Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look? Ok, what kinda machine is that? That's my joke, damnit Dwight. It's ok, they're with me. Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off. Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We'll, see you when you get out. Fine. Fine. Uh, that's what she said.  See, haven't lost my sense of humor.  No, no need, it was a non-stick grill. I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house.  Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few.  Very soothing.  [to the interviewer] Want to try? Right, I'm gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh.  Bureaucracy and germs. Yes, so, no thank you. What? Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk.  Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?  [stumbling] Oh, oh, oh.  Alright. Yeah, I've been sayin that. Did you know I used to be in HR? I used to be in HR.  I was a Hell raiser. Right? [laughs] Alright. Movin' on. Ry-an.  You're here.  Whatcha got, whatcha got?  Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused.  Where's Little Man Tate? Oh come on. Oh man.  It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy. Mmm, I'm telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food.  You know how they say 'stuff a cold'?  Well I don't care you've got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon. No. No, I'm not calling your weirdo cousin.  Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm. Guh-od. Ok, I'll stand near you. Next-ish. Shh shh shh shh. No. Do you? Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me. What's up-dog? Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant! Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog? Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog? I don't know, nothin', what's up with you? [low] No, damn it! What does what mean? Just forget it. Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog? Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing? [low] Damn it. Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a... No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say. Yes. On a Friday? [Dwight nods] I will do all the talking. What difference does it make whether your here? Hi, Oscar its Michael. Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather? Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic. What are your symptoms? Umm, hmmm. I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you're still sick.  So have a great long weekend. He sounded sick. That's exactly what I was thinking. Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs. Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time.  It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you. Hey Jim-bag. Really? Who else knows? Wow! Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can. My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles. [singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us... Hey, whatcha gettin'? Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night? Any of em?  So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the 'P' situation? P-A-M. P-A No it's okay, we're talking code. Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda? Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding? [Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it. It's Grrrrrrape! Soda. Not so much. Nothing. Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets. Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is. Ok. Good. Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin' for lunch? Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat. Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who. I know just he place. [at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it? Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings. Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi. We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers. I'm his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants. Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast? Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles] No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog. What do you like best about Pam? Is it her boobs, or... Really? Never get's any of my jokes. Her boobs, definitely. Oh, thank you. Ohhh happy birthday Jim! Woo! Yeah! Thank you very much. Hilarious. Hey. Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes. Just do it. [Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses. No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig? Yeah, it's a business lunch. No he did not. I don't need his permission. Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right? I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us. Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related? You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please? You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me. I know, I know, I know. I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid. Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just. Yeah I'm good. Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim. No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend. It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise. Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out. People are always coming to me. 'Michael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust.' No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott. Hello. Pammy want a cracker? Oh, Pam with the dirty talk. [laughs] Oh! No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that's much harder to do. No, no, no, no. I don't want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor. [sets mug on the edge of Michael's desk] All right. Jack Nicholson for birdie. It's a celebrity tournament. Do you see it? Do you feel it? [mug falls off Michel's desk and smashes on the floor] God... damn it, Dwight! That's great. [pulls a brand new mug out of his desk door] That won't be necessary. Look at all them out there, my little worker bees buzzing away. No, I am the King bee, No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee. Keep. I will finish that later. Yeah, I know when it's from, Ryan. Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what? I don't believe in paying for friendships. So, I made a decision not to accept any offers. And fortunately none were made. Which was good, so nobody's feelings got hurt. Thank you, Dana. Keep the change. Here you go buddy, happy birthday. You're welcome. No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it'll be hysterical. Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits. Spamster! Hamster. Welcome back!  How was your vacation? Yeah? Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink! I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay. [walking into office] Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck! Wow!  What happened in there? There is stink in there, my God!  What is... what is that? Is it a bird? Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet. Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. Check it out. Check it out.  Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee. What is it? What is it?  No, just tell me what it is. I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there. How do you know that?  What is it, then? [as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great. [walks into office] That is worse. [while in his reeking office]  I am a big Fear Factor fan.  I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um... [clearing throat]   I can't stand it [gets up to leave], I can't stay in here another second.  No! [sitting at Jim's desk]  Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet. Oh... It's ... [reluctantly] Yeah ... No, no, no!  Seriously, I don't mind sharing. [putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen. Don't ape me. This is great. The pressures of my office are insane. I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here. Yeah. Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust]  Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, 'Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work.'  What a jerk.  He's... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away. You know who used to sit at that desk? Mm-mm.  Todd Packer. Yeah. He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  He'd come in and sit there sometimes. When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls].  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today. Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay. Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn't hired. Charley horse! Charley horse! Oh, okay.  Gah. Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles]  It was hysterical. [whispering] Dwight. Let's send up Accounting. Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead. Hey guys. Ahem.  What's up? Yeah! Oh ho ho [laughing] No, no, no, no.  We don't do that.  We don't do that. Watch out, Pam. You're next! Maybe! Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I don't know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her. You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense. Stop. Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop.  It.  [Dwight beings to dial] Don't.  Don't. All right. Hi, guys. I'm just walking around. Well, yeah. Oh, and I'm not?  Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun?  You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you?  I'm workin' for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what we're gonna do.  I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good? [counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we? Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on! God, this is gonna be fun. [on phone] So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you. [hangs up] Yes! [chuckles] Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that! [puts post-it on Phyllis' forehead]  Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  That's my sale! [humming then dancing victoriously] [stops dance] Nothing. No.  Just ... You know what, guys?  It's none of your concern.  It was official business, so just... Yeah, paper business.  Is this done? Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. [snaps] This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them. You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today. You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage. I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about. Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I... you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done . [no one comes forward]  Very well.  Then you are all punished. You're all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer]  No.  NO!  [phone continues to ring] Do you remember Ed Truck? How would I know? My biggest fear is turning into him. [sighs]  I wasn't talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you? [meeting Ed Truck in parking lot] Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin' back. Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now. Oh, no, no, no.  You're good.  It was clerical.  You're good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me. I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible. Really? Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you? Well... s-sure I can. Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father. Well, okay.  Different management styles. Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, 'Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney.' [on phone] Yes. Who is this?  How did you get this number? Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin'? Uh... no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it? Really? Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it? Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office? Are you kidding me?  Oh! That was Packer!  Oh, you're... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you. Oh.  [laughs and claps] Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer! It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I don't expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people.  We have fun. [giggles] We just have fun!  Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out. [on the phone] Okay, that quantity of cotton fiber will cost you... my screen disappeared. I know. I will click on the bottom and... Yes. I'm getting one of those little hourglass things. Used to have a price chart on the wall, now it's a little hourglass thing with an arrow next to it. Now it's just an hourglass thing. Uh-huh, yeah, well, or I can call you back. Okay. What's going on? Anything here? Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or... Ah. Small? Huge? Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or... What was that? You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you? Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog? No, I did not. Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke. Do you know a joke? Call a client right now. And tell him the joke. Strike while the iron's hot. A joke always works. Just sell it. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line. The old one two. Let's do it. [on the phone] Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he's a little... Little dim. He's the janitor's brother, so... [on the phone] Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight. [on the phone] What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper. [on the phone] Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I'm glad it timed out that way. I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives. [knocks] Hey, what's going on? Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say. Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads... No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason. They did this up in Albany... And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like... [stands up] Anybody want any coffee or... Women in the workplace... yeah, translation 'I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.' Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh! Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this! [in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap. Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing. Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable? We have nowhere else Jan. This... OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works. Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months. So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear? You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing. Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy... Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing. [points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little 'Good Will Hunting' situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind. Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there. Guys! Want to start unloading the truck? Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are... [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff. Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself. Stand clear. I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up. We ought to have this thing serviced. So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so... No, why? Why would I... ? You could... Stay or... Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know? OK. OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh... I... That was just... I was breathing. I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men. OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it. I feel you. Yes. Ah, you do. So... I know. God! What is that? It blows. It blows, man. Gah... No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah. You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys. Dockworker's? Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks. The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them. Yeah-es. [knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points... Don't get hysterical. Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women. Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons? Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you. But we're bonding down there! I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear. Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through... We have a history... ...between us. I won't I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever. Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this? Hi. Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially... I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some... I'm just going to put this over there. You did uh... okay. Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza? Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch. Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship. Thank you to our hosts. Ahhh! Excellent. Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting. Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring. And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed. There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here. Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing] No, no. [blues piano playing] Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, 'I am so lame.' Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like... [imitating jackhammer] You know what I'm talking about? Yes. What are you guys talking about? Cool. Working on it. Yup. All right. Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO. Nope. The opposite of that. Ok, good. I probably will, why do you ask? Yeah. What This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love. Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything? Alright. Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya! Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name. The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.] Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here. Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there. This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh. I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it. There they are. What's up? Hey hey. Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam. Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists] You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true? So what's going on? What I miss? Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence] Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it. Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and... You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it, Yeah, yeah. Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan? What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.] [video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on. Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about. [video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!'] Questions? Yes, thank you. Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report] Oh, ok. Alright. No you're not. Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So... Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David. I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane. No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael] I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins] I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again. Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again. Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.] Oy vey... schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.] Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you. I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course. I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff. That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it. This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great. Great. Thank you. Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see. You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing. Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then... Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say. Have to think it through. Because if they say no... No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted. Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me. Hey, Dwight. You all right Ryan? Pam! That's what she said! Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon? Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life. Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year. That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act. That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time. But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company. Well, if you have a question, you should ask me. Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot. Insult. [stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class. Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs! I do. Both of them. No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this. Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars! [generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations. You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them. No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience. He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible. Yeah. All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it. As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking. Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast. Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative. Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up. Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today. Well, it's mostly made up. So... Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing. Confidence, Dwight. It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here. All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right. Dwight, they called your name. All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right! Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone? Car starting. [makes car sounds]  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone. Good luck. That is a tough crowd. I got thirsty. How'd it go? You would not believe what happened here. Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35. Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.' She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right? Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys? That's it? You're going to end with 'etcetera'? Okay, what's this big organizational system that... That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries. It's your delivery... Our biggest worry. My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. [clears throat] [shouting] See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn. No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin. All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke. Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water. Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Who's gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we'll move around. Go ahead. Anything your heart desires. [shouting] Louder! Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next. Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there. Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so... Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death. Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know. Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room. Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope. You're weird. Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go. Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? 'Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?' 'Jell-O pudding.' Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car. [imitating race car engine] That brings me to my... Brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients. It's important to because a client list is next to godliness... List. [baby crying] Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude. Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w--- ... Oh, God is that today? Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in 'Raw,' and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in 'Daddy Daycare.' both great movies, but, still. Well, I'll be in my office. They're cool. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City. Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys? [under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds. Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her. Oh. Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time. It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle. [while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads? Okay. [on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow. [on phone] Yes. Well... we can... [Sasha walks in, begins playing with Michael's toy train] uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael's desk] Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name? Nice to meet you. Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try? All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh] Dwight! Dwight! What the hell are you reading to them? Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you. What's a Nazi? Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it? [sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay? Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook? Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up] This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions? No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it. Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate... I'm not just a middle... man... You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business. ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right? Say hi to the kids. Yaaaaay. What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem? No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay? You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show. It's true. I did. I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star. It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar. I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? Oka-- Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office. [to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like? I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake. I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan? That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to... Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow. Yeah. Uhh, I don't know. Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it. Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh. Coulda sworn there was... ...uh, no. Uh, just never happened. Uh, nope. I do okay. Yes. Okay! Alright, okay. ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye. [Toby knocks on door] Yeah? Oh, that's okay, she can keep those. Thank you. You have to ask me that because you work for human resources. Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost. Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids? What about... ...Jan. Kay. ...Or biologically. Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I... Oh... kay. Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at. Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do. [singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well... One more time. [singing] You... Hey, don't touch him, please! Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys. [exclaims] Well, I'm sure it'll be fine. Sure. Okay. There you go. So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you. Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend. Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will! You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright. Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call. Oh ho ho! What? Thank you! That's really nice. Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a What's up? Ah, thank you sir. [Dwight knocks on door] Yeah. Ohh, god. No no no, no, new suit, please. Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria. Good luck. One of a kind. Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday. Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise. Let's get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in] [answering phone] Yeah? Oh, great, put her through. Hey, you. It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday. Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday. Thanks. [grins] Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up] [to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want. Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday! Thanks. Somebody got donuts for my birthday! You didn't know it was my birthday. Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box]. Mmm. Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman's pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright? [laughing] Okay. I'm so nervous. When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday. [eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that? Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything. You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster]. What? [grinning] Ohhh, God. Ohhh, no. Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this. Okay. Thank you. Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please. Get in here... everybody. Birthday party subs! My gift to you. The best. Yes. Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good. Just the bread, it's fresh baked. Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it. When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So... Kevin? Respect the birthday please. Are you done? ...Good. Okay. Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles] ... I asked for trick candles. Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day. ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door]. There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover. Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is. And laughter... also. Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party. [mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day. Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry. Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. How dare you sir. You are gross. [sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there. No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on! Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids. Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it. Kevin. You heard anything yet? Okay. Well. Live strong. Alright. Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or... Oh, these... all your kids? Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now! Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me. Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin]. Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos. Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey! Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight. Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks. Yeah. Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it. That's not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat] Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me.' A great boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.' Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present. Good. Great. No, I think you're gonna stay. On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today. [knock on door] Mmm-hmm. Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them. Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good. Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry. Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.' Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body. Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow. [fake coughing] Narc! I wasn't attempting to compliment you. Uuf, well... [shakes head] Okay... Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies? Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin? Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble? Waa... what? What are you talking about? Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it. Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection. I can do that, it is my office. Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great. It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about. No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.' I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind. Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children. Are these facts scaring you, or are they not? Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool? Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with? Yes it is. Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair. I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly. Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam. Really? [Jim shakes his head no] Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well. The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not. Yes, I will not be. Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you. So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done. Just forget it.  Just the urine. Just. I need your urine. Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight. It's none of your business. Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring. I need clean urine for the lady. Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens. No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup. Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much. What's wrong? Where's your costume? Why?  Wha... Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch. Yes, sir. So you wanna? Thanks. Okay. Good. No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes] Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you. Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon. Exactly. I know. It's amazing. Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine. One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar... No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me. No? okay, fine. Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping] Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel. Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we? Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out. Well... I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay? Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent. That's a nice tie. That is... who makes that? Do you mind if I wear that for the photo? [walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio? What's the problem? So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating? Yes. Yeah? Okay. What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So... Okay... what? Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please? [holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style. No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose. Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation? Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work. [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements. Come on, seriously, that? Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win. Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win. Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution. Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win. [claps his hands twice] It is done! Yes. Are those all the other complains? I would like to see those please. You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file. Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it? Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything? [looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist. You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me. How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute? That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ? Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago. All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next. Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right? Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club. [crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes? What?! Stanley. [off camera] [still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it. Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true. Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee. And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him. Oh... ok. Okay, well... all settled, then. OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell? All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable. Uh. Dwight. Okay! Calm down. Hey, hey! Stop. Okay... Dwight... Stop... Oh... kay... Okay. Yes. Mm-hmm. [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat? Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match! Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage. Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.' [reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.' [reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.' By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.' The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful. Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later. Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work. Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week? Good. Okay. Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here? Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right? It'll take like two seconds. Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter. Come on, everybody. We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts. Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more. What? [off camera] You just press the button. [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out. [off camera] That's terrible. [off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down] It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up. [flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I? But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems. And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand. Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice. On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that. I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot. There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway. There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person. Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal. Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no. Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good. I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing. Top 80 percent! Yeah? Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam! Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez. Oh, come on. Come on. You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break. Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day. Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America. Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts. Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration. So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief. Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people. Well, then, they need our money more than ever. Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna... Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS. No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS. What? That's a dog. That's a shawl. No. Humans with AIDS. Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried. There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams. I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works? It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place. Well, actually, it's my warehouse. Why are you here? Not. I said, not that. That's ironic. That you are afraid. Dinkin' flicka. Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture] [phone rings] Yes Who? Do I know a Carol Stills? Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it Hi, Carol. How you doing? Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place. Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped. Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night. Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink. Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you... Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes? Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume? Hey, Jan. How you doing? I am? Oh, okay. AIDS. Okay, sounds great. Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just... Right. Yeah? What? Okay. Problem. Good. Good, All right. Sounds great. Bye. Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody. Hey, hey. Hey, Carol. You look great. Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks] Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters. Okay. Billy, your nurse is hot. Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet. Chili's is great. Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss. Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows. All-in. [Other players fold their hands] Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me? What are... That's insane. Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back. Okay, all right, whatever. You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves] Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jan. Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship. After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong. Um... Hey. What... All right! Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go! Yeah! So close. So close. Hey, okay. Thank you. Okay. Thanks for coming. Okay. Talk to you Monday. Good night. She's a good boss. Oh, she's great. Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good. Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money. No. No. I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors. Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning] How about a location? Where the hell is that? Okay, all right. No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective. We already have that. So... No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun. Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.' One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over. Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse. Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money. Paper money. [clears throat] Yeah. The company's doing fine. Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it. Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle. No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive? That's what faggie means! It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard! Exactly! Yeah, I know. OK, a little too far, crossed the line. I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don't... You don't call retarded people 'retards'.  It's bad taste.  You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend. Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea. No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude. Can you tell who's gay and who's not? What about Oscar? Well, he [deep sigh] There could be others...  I need to know.  I don't want to offend anybody else. Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay. Hey, what about Angela?   She's hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman. I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you? Do some research.  Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them. That's ridiculous. [sighs] Let's call him and get the website. Well, they're sold out. I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so... What?  What does that even... Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival. I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about? I don't kn-- Anything's possible. [laughs] Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody! The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays. Trick question!  Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer? [looking at gay porn] Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood!  I don't particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually... it is quite beautiful. [yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room!  I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW! Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men. We're all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I'm doing this for you. Who should be the judges and juries of our society? Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right? That's great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  [laughs] See?  Everybody has a chance! But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do! [laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment. Well, I just like to look good OK, so --- No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero! No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is: Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag. You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend --- ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me! All right, um... sorry. [sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie.  You're not faggie.  You're a a good guy. [embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  [awkwardly kissing Oscar]  I did it.  See.  I'm still here.  We're all still here. [everyone claps] [Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar]  Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man! We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way? I am glad that today spurred social change.  That's part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...that's what she said.  Or he said. Oh, there's Gill.  Oscar's roommate.  I wonder if he knows? I will do my job to the best of my abilities. I will do my Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients. Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I [quietly] No. Okay. [Jan hangs up. Toby opens the office door.] [sigh] Hi, honey.  You holding up? Yeah. Oh, good. By yourself? Aw. Well, hang in there, okay?  You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn't miss you-know-who so much. Roy. Pam? Did you see Oprah yesterday? I, uh... I am going to be a father. Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost. I know. Well... Just do it, okay? Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay? Eight months? I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months. You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby... Twenty years. Thirty. It's a deal. Yesh. Right there. Ah. Per diem. Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo. Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom? Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker. Yeah, do it! Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim? Um. Okay, um. You got that? Write it down. Um. Hey, Josh, how ya doing? Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns. I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut. Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too! Hey! Ah. Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules. The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention. Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you. I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic. That is crooked on that side. Hey hey! Yeah. Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop. Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen? Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday. All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up. Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet. SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG. Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin. You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come. Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there? So maybe. See ya. Because he's afraid to fly. Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there! Yep. Yeah, she's up front. I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello? [into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please? I need you to do something for me. I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic. And? Business has been pretty crazy around the office. Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk. I will call him later with that message. Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left? Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically. Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip. You're welcome. No, that was a different hundred dollar bill. I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening. The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited. Any messages for 308? All right. Hey hey, fellers. What's up? Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton. Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend. Okay! Excellent. Oh... Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam! Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye. You first. Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing. Well, let's... Come on! Come on! Fine. Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work. Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for. Sorry, my meeting ran late. Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill. Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products. Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me. Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend. This is the party. Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right. People have been filtering in and out. What? Sure. You like Cosmos? Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy? I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just... I'm not better than Josh. Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her. Yeah. I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling. Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out. Evan, this is Jim. Hey, Ernie, how ya doing? Best friends. Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly. Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha. Whoa. What are those stains? Oh, God, I hope it's urine. Today I'm headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy. [Angela enters Michael's office] Ah. Per-diem. [singing as he signs] Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! [shows off $100 bill to Ryan] You know, Ryan, it's all about the Benjamins. [points to door] Right there. Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me. Sure you don't want to come? Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot. A couple of years ago, I went to one in Hartford. 'Connecticut.' And Todd Packer and I went to this bar and met a girl. And [laugh] Packer decides to make out with her. Turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar. [laugh] I love this. The bouncer chases us out to Packer's Vette, jump in the Vette, he See that factory? I almost worked there. Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there. I was going to be a bottle capper. I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world. Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he's doing now. He's a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the... [laughs] He doesn't even get to play in the game, I mean. [waiting on Pam to be done with the microwave] Ahhhhhhhhh. [whispering loudly] I'm hungry. Movie Monday!  The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues! Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Alright, everybody here?  Yes. Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu! Entourage! Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week? Don't whine.  Get the window. [Dwight exhales] Previously on Varsity Blues... [Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds! People work faster after... No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie. Ok. Ouchy. Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael] Hi. Oh.  That's nice. ...what? ...you were at the dentist? Ok. What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  She's my ex-lover!  ...ish. Hey Dwight. Do you want an M&M? No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good. They're good, huh? Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in. Sounds like a good dentist. What's his name? Your dentist's name is Crentist. Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist. Let me see your teeth.  Let me see 'em.  Let me see 'em. You should... floss. [exhales] Well then... I am glad you're ok. Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  [smiling] Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.  We don't have the technology. Dwight, can I talk to you for a second? [in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough. Ohhhh.  Arrrgggh! Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me. Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job! And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. I know.  I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me.  You've been my most trusted ally. Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it. [exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled. All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager. Ohh.. [muttering] Can't you?  That's so nice. Well... I guess we should go tell the troops. Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight. You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that. Because, Dwight... never lies. Because that's all it takes. Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty? Oh, I'll be fine. No, no, I don't, but--- I... won't.   I won't. Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring. It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it. What? But you said you liked it.  You've always admired it. [Michael finally breaks] Take it back. That's my car. THAT'S MY CAR. I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know. Jan called me about your little meeting! I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight. Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight? Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?! Not.  Good.  Enough! I have a laundry machine! I don't know if I can trust you anymore. You can get up.  Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch.  [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace] Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And they're done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn't translate. Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, [cut to Dwight standing on a box with 'LIAR' written on a piece of paper hung around his neck, Dwight's head hung in shame] and I'm making him do my laundry for a year. Okay. [Jan leaves Michael's office; Dwight enters] It is not your business, Dwight. What do you know about management, Dwight? I'm not firing anyone. ... What? Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let's get back in there. [no takers] Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let's go. Ryan? Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble. So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he's in love with her... [phone rings] Really? Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse? Oh, it's okay, I'm going down. All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs] [hands Ryan pencil]  There you go. You're welcome. Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk] There you go, fresh from the warehouse. There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam. [breathless] All right.  Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee] I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained. [sighs] All right. Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me? Oh, wow. Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died. Yes, I am.  It's very sad.  Because he was my boss. That's right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up. So did you hear the news? Yeah. Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life. [holds out arms to Pam] Yeah.  Mmmmmm. Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin'. The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die.  You knew that. What? Oh my God. That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him. [clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this... What are you doing? I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out. I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here. You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off. [thoughtfully] A statue. Yeah. Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him. We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move... I think that is a great way to honor Ed. Life-size. Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan. Mm hm. Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck. But Ed truck can't because he is--- DEAD. That's perfect. Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam. What? Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head! Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work! There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job. I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone. Okay, fine.  Hurry back. [as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start.  Um... Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot? Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else. [returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go. Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam. Wow.  If you wanna cry, that's okay. Do you want to talk about it anymore? Wait a second.  That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game? All right, we're starting over. You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done. Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. [breaking down] How do you know? That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing? Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying] [seeing bird] Oh, God! Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ... Oh shhhh--oot! No, he's not. No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face] Well, you can't get diseases from a bird! We don't know if it's dead. Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird. Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it. No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him. It's okay.  It's okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show. What are... What are you doing? No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!? Glad you could all make it. Dwight, do you have the box? You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice. Yes. Shhh. Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown. Oh, wow. He... Does his family know? But I'm the first in the office? Okay, yes, sure, I will do that... ...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up] Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad. I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we'll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace. What was that, Kevin? No, you said something, didn't you? You think that's funny. You are disgusting. No, that can't be right. Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it? You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice. Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met. No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay? I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, 'Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?' These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats. Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said. I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball. [in his office playing with a Dunder Mifflin Truck when it drops and the 'head' of the Truck comes off] That's... Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there. [Dwight digs hole in ground] Just dig. Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right. [Michael starts digging] Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use? Uhhh... nothing. Yeah, nothing. How was your day? Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that? I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear? Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base. Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too. Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me. [looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on. Uh huh. [Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing? No, I think you're cutting in line. No, I'm not going to settle down. Get in the back please. Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five's Stanley]. That's right. No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind. I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel. Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown. Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back. Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left. Thank God. Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them? All right! Thank you! Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal? Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second... Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. And I will be taking questions. Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much! Hey, what time is it? AM or PM? Oh, good. Oh. Koselli. With the Jello. Yes. Right. Good. Goodnight! Well, that's really not the way I roll, because sometimes I'm in the zone, and sometimes I'm in the zoning out. Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it. Yes, big if. A woman spurned. I always do. If you lay a finger... Would you look at that? [Hugs Ryan] [Dwight attempts hug] Damn it, Dwight! Come on. 9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE: log. Lost log. Found log.' '10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.' That's on the wrong page. Okay. That sounds good. [puts banana in toy mouth that's in his mouth] [laughs] Yes. Actually, today's a good day to do that. What makes them so good? I mean, they're just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth. Nice dress, Ryan. [laughing] OK. Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween. How come you didn't get me one? Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional. It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby. Wha? Really? You should! It's fun. I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol. Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on. Kelly? Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday. All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'. Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... ' Okay. Spoiler... alert. Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What's the... oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from? And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before? Thank you, Kevin. Well, I find it beautiful. No... No, You're not going to collect them. No. This is delightful, charming culture. My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight. [points at woman] What does that look like to you? No one's even going to notice. Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol. I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions... Oh, yuck. [spits out food] No. These s'mores are disgusting. Do you think they have any s'mores? All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been? Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night? Wow. Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet! She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks! I'm going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband. What do you say? I didn't hear you. [laughs] [lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay. No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic... Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much. Yes. Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra. All right. Good night. Oh, God! [chokes on food] Oh. Wow. That's so spicy. Oh. You waiting for a call? Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements. I was in that marriage arena, though. Yeah. Uuuuh... well. We're so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her] What are you doing? I'm... what? I didn't [scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home? These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'. Sorry. This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali! How do I explain this to Jan? Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less. An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. [to phone] Pam, could you put Jan on, please? Hello, Jan. Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party. What is Diwali? You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween--- ---rolled into one. I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in... ... customer service is a Hindu person. And. Yeah. You do? Oh, I dunno about that. For Kelly, that seems a bit much. [hangs up] Yeah, you should see her naked. I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, 'Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,' and she's like 'I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication.'  And I'm like, 'Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night.' And she's like, 'What the hell are you talking about?' And I'm like, 'I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof...' [cracks himself up] ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh... [calms down] So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party. And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan. Yeah? So, any questions? There she is - Jan Levinson. First... ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan. [singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby. Yes. I don't understand. On whom's authority? What? You're welcome. Am I a small number person or a severance package person? Oh... [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up. Well... Oh, you gotta be... Josh? Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe? It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm. Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast. Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please. Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can. Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life. Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so... Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway. What? Do I have any messages? Ok, ok... [facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down. You knew about this all along, didn't you? Traitor. You are a traitor. I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst. Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs] I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me. So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and... Awesome. This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance. All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let's go. Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup. Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch. No... way. No. There's no one else. Okay, okay. Um... Why? You sent him cards? You never met him. Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else. I will improvise. I will speak from the heart. All right. Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings. [no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that. Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay? Don't touch me this time. Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? [takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie] The office. No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news. Anything? What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under? [pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go. That was hilarious. The foam ... Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good. Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. God, Dwight! What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car. Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore! What?! We did it? We did it. Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight's] Yeah, baby! We did it! How did we do it? I don't understand. Here... Who's here? Yes, please. Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li. Okay. My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales] Who's next? Andy Bernard. Saint Bernard. What? I'm not... I'm not firing somebody on the first day. Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league. Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr. Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here. You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So...  As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'. Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name? Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay. Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later. Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader. Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh? Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome! A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you. Oh. They are nifty! They're nifty gifties. You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him. [to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man. [to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you. Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is... Right. [talking to himself] I present the orientation video. Not now. I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale. It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one. I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok? Work it out amongst your selves! Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company? Will you? Please? Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in! Yoko shack. Nope, no. Guests only. Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo. Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy. No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself. Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please. Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'. Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'. So check out how we live They call it Scranton. The Electric City. Scranton. The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider. [in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food. You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot, [on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What? Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'. Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I... All right. Okay. What is that? A squid's eye or... How did you... People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause. I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just. Ssshh stupid! Um... That's it! Yes, yes! Okay! Okay, here we go. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Scuse me! Scuse me! You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow! You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy! [laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor. Okay! Okay! All right, all right, I'm on a roll. Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them. Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would. I understand. We're all friends. Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up. You know what? I'll help. I will... Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this! Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up. Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here. We've almost got it. Push it! Push it! I'm right in your crack! Up and over. Up and over. You've got it. You've got it, you've got it. Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay. Easy. Don't... What... I don't understand. Well, we'll squeeze you in. You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what? My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny? Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired. You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk! Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you. Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight. Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide. No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King. The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it. Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires. Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on! Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators. Yeah. Go home, Toby. Just... Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] 'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!' No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh... THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious! See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o! Hi, Jan! I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted. Yes. But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two. What? Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos. So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two. Uh... that I have not decided yet. Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks. Shut it... Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up! And this is, don't tell me, Martin... Ne... Ne...Nack. Martin Nash. Okay. Good. What are you talking about? All right, just... Smiles. Good, what's funny? Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power. Good. Hey, girls. What's happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle. Can't we all get along?  No, we can't. But here's the thing: yes, we can. Well, why not? Because of differeneces. Well, can we overcome these differences?  No. Can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences? No, we can't. But, we have to try and that is why I created the Integration Celebration. I need somebody to pick a card. [Dwight raises hand] One of the new people, please? Tony? [Tony walks away] All right. Good. Thank you. [Andy picks a card] Do not look at your card. Now, I've always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here [puts hand over heart]. So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card. So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be [starts to fan out the rest of his cards facing the group showing kings of hearts] a king of hearts. Dwight, don't, don't be a suck up. What I want all of you [points at Scranton branch] to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot? Okay Meredith, let's give it a shot. [clapping] Beautiful. Very good, nice. Okay. We heard it. We heard what you said. You didn't cover it at all. [points at camera] They're gonna have... You can't say that, all right? [clearing throat noise] Idiot. Dwight's an idiot! Did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it? [cleaing throat] You're a jerk. Dwight's a jerk! Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute. Ohh. May I? [climbs under desk] Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from 'Look Who's Talking.' What am I thinking? [Laughs] Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts. Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know. I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. [Jan sighs] ... I'm just kidding. Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby. Hannah? Kuhhhh... you are such a racist. Because you think he's black. Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now. Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake. In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened. Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people. Good. All right. [everyone leaves] Just... try to be cool. Okay, are you cool, really? Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool! Hey Martin, how's it going? Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust. ...Danny Glover. [Jim raises hand] Yeah. Who? Oh. Please. Colin Powell. Yup. Apollo Creed. Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you. No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them. [laughs] That is awesome. Well, we are running a business, so. Ah. Well. That's not true. No you would not. This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison. Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go! Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up? It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone. Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time. Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint? Ah. A ten inch black and white? These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole. All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say 'Boo' because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?! Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap! Internet. And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom. And I nevah got caught, neither. Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair. Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks. The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt! No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. [turns around, takes bandanna off] So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it? Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room] No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas. They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so. [unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms! Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black. [Riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. [Struggling to stay on] 'Tis the ... ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint... I'm looking for the toy drive box. OK...  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks. Umm... I don't know? Average kind? Well, that is probably from the test drive. No. Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and explosion.] Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that. OK. Did everybody get one of these? Terrific. Good. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah. There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. [laughs] Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side. Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture] No, you get outta here. Yes. Thank you. Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp. That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings. I know. Right. Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart... And next to your kids. What? I don't understand? OK No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica's largest fresh water pool. I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is. And it's all inclusive. Yes. No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over. I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled. Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's. Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley. Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests. Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess. Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts. It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms. [moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts? Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary? And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to? Take it from Toby. Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me? It's all... [Pam walks away.] OK. What are you doing? ['Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt plays] Carol? I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it. [singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again] This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her. All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway. Hooters? Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael's office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters. Why not? Ok, feel better. C'mon Jim, let's go. Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'. Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy. Carol used to drink lattes. She would get this little foam mustache... And I used to say 'Hey, got latte?' And she'd say, that's not funny. She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy --- I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out... I'm just gonna call her. Nothing he's doing is cheering me up. Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away] You're right. That's good. I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party. Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak. Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style. I don't think... I love it! [laughing] I don't know what he's doing. You know what we should do? We should invite them to the Christmas party. Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion] OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's] The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike. Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours. Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said. Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend. [whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame. Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room. Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party. We're going to ... I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And... my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree? Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You're  lucky you're so darn cute. What're you talking about? When you know, you just know. Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable. It's... it's one of those two. [points at both] Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike. I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like? Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her. Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy's arm with a black marker] Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party. Hey, hey, you. How are ya? No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and... Where do you wanna go? I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica. You want help? OK... Merry Christmas. That waitress was the one. How can you be sure? Don't make fun... You're making fun of me. I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm. I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike! Oh, why do I feel like crap? I had rebound? Yeah. I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o. [on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive... William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I'm paraphrasing here, 'Love doth be poison.' Brilliant. And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes. No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don't dial Carol before I get drunk. Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea. [on [phone] No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did Oh, honey, here's Stanley. He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him. Sounds good. Okay, let's go. Hey, mon! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax. Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later. Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me. It was Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too. OK, well payroll is in charge of all that. Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna... You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon. Feelin' hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing. You know, I had never been out of the country before now? Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time. Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three. Inventory's at the end of December. I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it. Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans? Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it. The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.' How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need. Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem. No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue. Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan. [on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica. Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay. Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim. Oh no? OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it? Check it again. Hit refresh. OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... [reading computer screen] Packer@DunderMifflin.com. Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl? OK, Hey, man, how's it going? That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me? OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people? OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it. And you sent that out to everyone? I have a special assignment for you. A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.' Not important. OK, forget it. Not now, not ever. Aww, none of your business. That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops. This is probably the icebreaker you need. I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv. No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo? OK. Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat. She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK. There an accident? Somebody hurt? Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no. All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael] Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman--- No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe... My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right? Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell] Hey. Island living. You know? Did she say what it's about? There are copies in the bathroom? All right. Guh. OK, yup. I... I... I... Yes. OK, yeah. Who is Dr. Perry? I... And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well. So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh... Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately] Jan, you... complete... me. I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags. Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be. Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office. Me had an i-rey time. Dwight, please, please. I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon. Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig. Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there. You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. [puts lei on Angela] Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something. I'm just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts! [laughs] Try it on. Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did. Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja. I just got back from vacay. Come on. Give me a break, man. [holds up CD] Waves over Jamaica, $6.99. Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one. His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself. I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can't afford it, and corporate won't pay for it. So who's the real criminal? How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata? I... Oh, that's red eye. Well... Hey, can we just focus? Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott. Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay. Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold. [Kelly singing] Hey! Hey! Stop your mouth, please. Hey, Stanley, in case I don't see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash. Keep the change. [hands Stanley a piece of Jamaican currency] It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don't remember in which direction. Yes, good luck with that. Jim, could you come in here please? Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him. You know what? Get Pam. Pam. Oh, that is gross. Damn it. Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you. Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first. Oh. Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you. Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior. Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley. You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody. So that just leaves Dwight and Jim. Dwight? Here ya go. [throws laundry] Please. Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the 'Amazing Race.' [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go? No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back. Just bragging rights. It's just... brrrrrr... It's 'Amazing Race,' Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it. Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos! Here we go. Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment. Hawkman. [Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting. Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack? You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big. You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency. I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company. No. Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it. Yes. Ah, no. Don't worry about it. What? I don't know. Who knows how words are formed. Yes, Andy. He didn't say. No, you are remembering it wrong. Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three. I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in] Where were you this morning? Why do you lie, liar? You are lying right now. I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing. Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard. Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day. Good luck. Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover. Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman... I said 'was'. What does that even mean? That is impossible. But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits. Hey, what's up. Yep. I don't know. Maybe. Bathroom. Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible. Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning. Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office. Yeah, do you? What did I say? Huh. Oh, no. No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific. No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga. Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one. Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep. Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay? Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight? Really? Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close. Nice to have Oscar back. Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company. Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you? Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly. Um. No. I don't want to do any of that. No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy. Hey. What's up? Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did. Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize. How's this place treating you? Oh, well. No. I'm sure. So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right. Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute! Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh? Guilty. Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours. So does this remind you of your childhood right now? Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him] It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm. Hello son.  If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead.  Life is a road--- How, would you stop interrupting please? Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life. Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to. To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever. Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra. We will demonstrate on Pam. Come on. [Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks. Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam. And remember no matter what, I will always love you. He's not going to be a murderer. You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no? Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three- Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one.  This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta. I'm sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant. I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, that's for sure.  It'll probably be on a boat. What's up spinsters? No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy's night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys. Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh! [Clutches chest and falls to the floor] Oh God- No, no, no! I can't believe you're not going to be there.  It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man. You should get out of them. It's the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It's going to be great.  We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious. I did not order a stripper. Um, not personally, no. I can't get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment. So that's what that means. Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself] Gay. Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies. Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers. Well get on it.  And make it happen. [Giggles.] [Pokes Ryan with a sex toy.] Gotcha, oh! [Phone rings.] Yes? I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop. Squarepants? And you think that'd be sexy? Oh. Oh.  Hello! You wearing a thong? Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Who's a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin. Half pants, right Mr. Franklin? He's in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever. Yes, but, Ben Franklin was. And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow. Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis] Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors. No.  Yes. But I got all the foot off of it. Guys, beef!  It's what's for dinner!  Who wants some man meat? Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity. I call shuffle.  Here we go.  [Spreads cards out all over the table] Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth. Nice outfit. He's right there.  There he is. Okay.  Alright, I'll do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I? Alright. Okay. Here we go.  Alright! Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide. You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so... Yeah she probably, yeah she would be.  You know what, okay, excuse me.  Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music.  This is wrong, this is wrong!  This is wrong!  I have a girlfriend.  And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work! On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me. Really. Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag. Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me? Wow.  Thank you. Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will. I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand. No, today at work. Yes. I kind of arranged it. So you don't want to end our relationship? That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that? You are.  You are. So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't. Always the bridesmaids, right ladies? Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride. There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin. How you doin'? You excited. Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight? You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous... Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle? Here, let me... Just cover up that bald patch. Okay. You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet. [in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you! Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'. This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it. [whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking] This is bull****! Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight. I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over. Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance! Oh, shiii... Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you. Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too. Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter? I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back. I will take care of that. I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white. Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride 'Mawige... The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones. Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance... is a guy that... he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay. No. I'm not going to... Ok. All right. Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you! Come... Come on! Dwight, just... Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song. OK. [sings] ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu. I just want Phyllis to have a great day. We are great together. We are a great team. Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon. Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head. Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember. Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo. You're... You're welcome. They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad. Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other's face] Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! [Michael smears cake on his own face] Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you? Huh? Pop quiz. Why is today a special day? Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you... In business school, Kevin. Business school. A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us. Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you? Will they throw their hats, you think? A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air. Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: 'May your hats fly as high as your dreams.' ... That was a pretty good line. I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey! We have fun. Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo! Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now. I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it. Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel. So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied? Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies. ...And products! Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up. We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops] ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back. ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid. Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index? Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here? ...Wait, Ryan said that? Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay. David will always beat Goliath. Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school? Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT! Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things. You heard me, pack your things. Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex. A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business. Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town. Wow! You did these... freehand? My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much? I don't see a... price. Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car? That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you. What? ...Chunky. Do you want half? Okay. It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera. Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can't do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing. Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these. So no? Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales. No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are. Don't do what I say, say what I do. Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up. This... You know this is a scale of one to ten? OK. Do you want me to repeat that? Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. [goes to stand on desk] Just stand right up. That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK. I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars. Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for. Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep. No no no no no. Never follow, always lead. OK. Very good. OK. Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes. How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay. Can you confirm that the straps are tight? And now, the chains. A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school. MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can. No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE! I will get out. Oh yes, I will. No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.] AHHHH! Yes. I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key... Alright. Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm. Pam, would you smell my breath? Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special. Jimbo, last chance to carpool. Sure? Might be a good idea. Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip. Play some games? I spy? Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you. Hey, Buttercup. I am on my way. I should be there in about 15... That's what she said. Uh, yes you are. No problem. [doesn't turn off speakerphone] Ok. Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I... Ummm... I don't know. Maybe. Ok. Alright. Bye. Beauty. Thank you sir! Thank you. Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me. I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that. Yes. Ok. Hi. Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend. Oh, um, potato salad. No, it's not. Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here. It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know. What are you looking for? You bring dip? Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too. Over our love. You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all. It's a heart. I love this woman! Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So... Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. Ok. It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them. Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great? I could go for an appeteaser. Bagel bites or something. Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate. David, how much did this house cost? Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently] Yeah. Do you have any ice? How about some Splenda? This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out. You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas. Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo. Crazy. Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it? What are you doing? Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy. What has gotten into you? No, no, no. Come on, let's go back to the party. Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan. No, no, no, means please don't. Please. I'm not going to slam you up against the wall. You're acting inappropriate. Jan. Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan. Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle... You didn't have any of the potato salad did you? Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces. I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling. Whatever. That's all, you didn't mean it? I love you, Jan. What a weird day.  I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life.  Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.  Guess everybody has days like that.  Sometimes they're the nicest ones.  Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan. No need for consternation, everything is under control. It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled. No... No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage. Yeppers. I don't... remember. Yeesh... Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you. Wikipedia. Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information. Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise. Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl.  I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish] What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish] Ok, see what I did? By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position. Ok, let's try another one.  Um... Walking out of the room unexpectedly. It's a surprise. Go ahead, ask me for a raise. [gets up and begins to walk out of the room] What? No, what did you say? Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna... [knock on door] Yeah. Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat. You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room. No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room. Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws 'em off. Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control. [long pause] I am declining to speak first. Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now. What? No, this is a power suit. [Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes.  I would not make that mistake again. Ohh... kay. All right. Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit? No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin. There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit.  At the very least it's bisexual. Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery. Okay. Would you stop it, please? It's European, OK?  It's a European cut. No, they don't.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam] Italians don't wear pockets. No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway. Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes. Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes. Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise. [mumbles jibberish] [mumbling softly] That was a very good point. [mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument. I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me. Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes. Oh. [scoffs] Come on.  Be serious. I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much. I don't.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub. Plus perks, yes. Fourteen years. No, please, please... Ok, let's take 15, again. A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that. Oh, thank you. I didn't give you $40. Okay.  Okay, here's the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia. I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise. Well what am I supposed to do? I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous. [exhales] That's true. You know what?  I should. I have been a loyal employee for a long time. You know what?  I deserve a bump. I am makin' it happen, sergeant. No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today. Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I'll leave right away. Yes, I'm bringing Darryl. Mm-hm. Hey, I'd rather kill myself. [talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known. [sighs] Fine. Toby, come on.  Let's go. Where?  I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let's go. Yeah.  Fine. [imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio!  ...Chris Tucker. Well... Mm, the Big Apple. Maybe I'll stay. Well... [mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I... Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity. All right. Who's the boy toy? Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek? Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers. Pippity poppity. Six percent?  After all we've been through? I got you... jade earrings. No! No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball? Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me! Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I'm not going anywhere. Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I--- Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make--- Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Here's the rub.  I would like a 15% raise. But you just said 15. Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  It's about perks.  Like having sex with Jan-- Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot. Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity. Hmm. I can, and I have. Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  [points] Pudge has driven the forklift. I thought your name was Pudge? Okay.  Um, her. Ah, fine. Yeeesh. [barely keeping his composure] 'Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!' [laughs] Bail'er?  I hardly know her. Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody... It's a big red trash compactor! Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions... ...would I go near--- Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go! Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and... Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour? Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not? Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see.  'Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.' Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation. Yes.  Okay, let's do another one.  This is a good one.  'A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---' Yes.  'Which can contribute to heart disease.'  Heart disease kills more people that balers. Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary... No. Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I--- Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore? Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men's Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I'd like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make 'em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  'Hello, I'm Michael.  Welcome to Men's Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.' ... This is one example. Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right? Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff. I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that... Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science. Indubitably. They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes. I don't know, I don't know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression--- Nn--- Depression. Yes. You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  [Dwight nods] Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or... Go buy some watermelons. Just... Let's do it!  Drop that sucker. BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess. Find out whose car that is.  If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes. Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler. Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster. Yes, thank you for seeing that. I don't know if I wanna do this. No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking. Rock n' roll! That's right!  I am not thinking. Yes!  Yeah! Woo! Woo! I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar] [on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life... Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression. Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study! Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil! Wait, where are the warehouse guys? Okay... that's... That's the whole point, dummy. Okay. Oooooh, my life! Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed. Dwight, you ignorant slut. And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof! Damn it. What is it? Dwight, find out what the present is. Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it? You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life. What do I have to live for? It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be. Do you really mean that? I'm braver than you? I Braveheart.  I am. Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present. An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That's the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can't say.  But, yes. OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let's go. Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it. Here we go. Field Trip. Like we're going to the science museum. Learn by touching. I've been told that I'm a tactile learner. Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you... I... Sum it up Darryl, sum it up. We got beat today, Dwight. But it was not a fair fight. It was the warehouse guys... ... Dwight, they embarrassed us... ... because they had a much scarier safety presentation. You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny. How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I'm going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. [winks] Yeah, Drew. You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this? OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right. I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed. I will miss you the most Ryan. Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. [takes deep breath] Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines. [on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper. We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I've never been a fan. Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime. Crisis Management Squad. Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions? To save time, Jim. You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed? Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy. We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today. Midnight, Oscar! Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids. No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person. I want you to bring a partner. No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who's actually made a sale.  Andy, you go. No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference. No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves. Here's the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That's what happened to O.J. I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story. Here OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice. Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really. And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first. So, let us consider this matter ended. I know, I know you're angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry. Well, we are extremely sorry. We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again. The watermark... it's a one time thing. OK... What... can I do, for you? Well... [exhales] OK, well...  Um, wasn't really my fault.  The guys at the papermill--- The guys at the papermill--- No no no! I'm No, I'm a regional manager--- No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out! That's insane.  We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it. Doesn't matter.  Out please! Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that? We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not... No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it... You're right.  It will blow over.  But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for? [Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good. Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.' That's how devoted I am to this job. I know. I understand that, Dwight. Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut? So I'll know where--- I'm asking Pam to do it, please. OK, ready? Five, four, three.  'There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn't be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me.  They're trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.' That's... they always give an ultimatum. Good, cut? Thought so too. The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers. With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective. So we're good? I'm sorry. Okay. All right. We are infinitely sorry. You understand? You... you get this check. The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore. Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out. And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos. Are we ready? Okay. Am I shiny? Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net. [clears throat] Stop it. I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign. What's happening? Really? Is she OK? OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher] Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind? [laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it. Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone] What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down] Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs] Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul. Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher. Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong. In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me. Huh? I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls - Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable. I... uh, well, I don't know. [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house. OK. This is the last Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand] Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say. OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that. See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight? No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation. Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one? That is not current. You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women. I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter. Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited. OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie. What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this. Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything. No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist. Yes. Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut. I have to know whether you're serious or not. Ye - OK, yes. You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps] OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go! [Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping] Many women All right. Hope nobody's on a diet. You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish. Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese. What, um... what do you think of role-play? Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy. I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress. Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex. [groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form. No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it. No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing. No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs] OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt. Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested. She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex. Yeah, that's smart. That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know. I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan. Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories. Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here. Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked. Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear. Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It's Jan. What do I do? OK, it stopped. Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will... Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts] Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan? Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail. OK, I am really going to do this. You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs] I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail. [leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later. Thank you. Abso-fruit-ly. No... No... Yeah. Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.' [sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?' You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all. Love it. Uh, yes, I am. Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny. The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it. We should really start recycling. Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep? Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand. I got shotgun.  Damn it. Look at that! Come on! Free underwear! Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit. Idiot. I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves. Ughh... Blech. Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying... Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.] Maybe. Not it. I don't have eggs. That's possible. Uh-huh? The CFO? Ohh... OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK. To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace? And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there? Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes... ...you just gots to get your freak on. Yeah. Hmmm. Really? Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say. May God guide you in your quest. OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus. Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume? Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally. Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here. I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck. Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me. What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head. I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright? This way to the partay bus. Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach. If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus. Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner! Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off. Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down? Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't... Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you. Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes! Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor. Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley. Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam. Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something. I'm not playing. Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot. We are going to choose team names. Dwight? Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name? Then I will name your team the Red team. I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America. Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic. Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him. It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist. Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking] [off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook] Okay Pam, I have another little project for you. Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it. Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes? Thanks a bunch. A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success. OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set. No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready? Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat! No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily. Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize. I can't say. The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world. The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright? I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up. [points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it. Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs! 13 hot dogs, everybody! It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens. Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright.  It's alright. Here we go. Aaaaaand, go! Nice, Stanley! One. Two. Three. Excellent! I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points? Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook. Please just check. What does a great manager need most of all? Courage. Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE! Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score. Pointless. Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. Ji.. why not? C'mon. You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today. Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill. Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay. Yes. Count to three, please. Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one. Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three? Okay. Don't, don't. I'm not going to give it to you. Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.' Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. God! He's a comedian. Who's Amanda Bynes? Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got. You are being too modest. Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us. That is a very, very funny story. Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background. WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA! So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail. No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy. Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out? Acrimonious. This way to the party bus. Good. It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go. Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here? Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup] Nothing. No. No! No. No, we are not. You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off... ...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake. Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor. Any questions? Yup. Yes, for dramatic affect. Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready? Set! Go! [sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion? Because he wasn't following the rules. But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call? Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time. Okay, all right. It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can... Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set! No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily. No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry? Who's got the hungry? Come on, Ryan... Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now. [Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go! You? You haven't made a sale. Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out. Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs! This is an inflatable sumo suit. [blows] Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.  Well, times have changed. [blows] And it's not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.  It's about who is the best boss.  And I don't even care who wins. [blows] It's how they wrestle in a blow-up suit... [breathes in] that will tell me all I need to know [blows] or how sumo... [collapses] [at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David! Are we all set? Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello. Thought I'd catch a show. Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job. Um, how many people are you interviewing? Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people? Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge? Ah, great. No further questions. Okay. And I'm really looking forward to working with you. I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late. [knock on door] Yeah. Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. Okay. Uh... Uh, okay. Stop crying. Ohhhhh... Why so you can do it? No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... Moon each other. All right. Your loss. Cruise control. There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me. No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo. Yes, I... I have to buy another place. I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time. Who is D. Abramson? Why... are you here? I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you. Why privately? Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of. Okay. Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem. Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen. No. She's an alternate. So, how you been? Good. Yeah. Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages. Hmm. Sound good. Sounds fun. Hmm.. Would you excuse me for a second? Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together. I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please... No, no. What do I do? What if she makes me? She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do. I wasn't. You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together. Wow. I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you. [walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged] Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out. Yeah. First got priorities. Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs] No.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you this, it is [holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable. Wait, wait. Check one more time. Very good [Jan nods] Yes, indeed. So, I guess we're getting back together. Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger. Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery. Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck. [exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything? I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names.  If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me. That Mm-hmm. No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so... I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep. Hey!  Hunter!  Wha's up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire. Jan in yet? Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in? Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means. Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also? [knocks on door] Hello, hello! Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for. Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job. Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths. Thank you. I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that. Okay. Thank you. It is always a treat when Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals. I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it? Hey. Pretty good. Could have gone better I guess. Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later. Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun. I can't tell you. Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan--- Hey! No--- We're all unstable. David, I did not tell her. So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job. Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions. You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal? Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though. Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates. I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible. Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK. [whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile. [in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack! No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon. Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black? That's stupid. You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee. No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids. So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones. [to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee. Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day. Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me. Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest. Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not! New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win. Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. [walks into bedroom, Jan sleeping on bed] This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. [sighs] She probably won't be up for a few hours. This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed. [slams on breaks, camera turns, Meredith rolls off the hood] Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car. It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK. Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse. Yeah. Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her. Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something. It was an accident. No. My lord my liege. So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish? So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back. Well, I ran down Meredith in my car. No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in... Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine. Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine? Ok, I have an announcement. No. No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree. So, like a freedom tree. Pam. Pam. Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch. Excellent! Good work Pam. Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun? Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley! Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make. Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel. No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault. No... She's in a coma. OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear. Yeah. Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake! Nurse. [groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke. Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody. Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness. Well, just shhhh... just just... Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug. Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith. Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised. OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just... Sprinkles? [sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it. Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious. Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground? Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us? Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan. Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you? Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects. Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs. Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite. Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in. OK. Alright. Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha. Are you sure? What are you? OK, 1 Sikh, and... You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead. Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine. Oh God, Rabies? I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD? This place is so cursed. [walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it. Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished. Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad? Pro-Am. A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that. Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far? Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00. That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming? Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis. Yes. OK. [walks away] Alright, alright. Shhh... I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts. OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant. Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore. We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later? Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So... Yep. You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going? What about a rabies nurse? That's possible. Look into that. Have you met that kid? He's not going to college. Come in. Hey, hey, hey What are you doing? No I didn't, just please don't... May I enter the room? See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear. Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that. European offices are naked all the time. Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so... That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun. Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here? OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing. No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said? He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here. Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth? Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands. You got it? OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load. Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing. [pulls Toby's pants down] Beow! On your left! I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab] No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity! Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do. That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock. [laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax? [Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans] [runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit. [bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line] I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just... What do you want me to do Jim? No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins. That's a good deal. Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done. You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference. You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no! Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that. Hey Mer. How ya doing? It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water. Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share? I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good. Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car? Well... That's not... That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting. I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that? Okay. Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don't know whose fault it was.  I wasn't exactly looking at the road. You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim? Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that. Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point? I'm not going to leave until you forgive me. [standing for a while, sighs, turns to walk out] Oh, okay. This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it. Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes. On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown. We have to have done something wrong. That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse. Oscar, are you Santaria? Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting. Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition. Stupid. Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won't do it. Whoa, 'scuse me!  Oh! Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow... Come on, I'm going backwards. Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right! Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting] Thanks. Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um... I kinda wish I'd been hit by a car. Hey, doc?  You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael]  Thank you. Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff] [reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection. Oh really. Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight... [turns to address Jim and Pam] No way. Woooah! Wow! Awesome! You guys! Yes! Yes! Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one. I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim] No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest. Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said. No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it] Blowing up balloons I thought. Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream. Hey! There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs. Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm.. ...business meeting -- That's right! That's right! Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan. Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man... Beard. Oh, wow! That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way. Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me. Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes? Sounds good. OK, alright. Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, 'Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.' His words. OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave] Who is? I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred. Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual? Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no? Good, so, we're on the same page? We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans. Hey. [holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles? I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids. Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people. Well... What is that... word? So older people have just as many rights as younger people? Good, we're all here, we can get started. Have a seat. Have a seat. Like everybody else. Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did. Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much? No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah. I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone. [puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in] Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door] Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other] Bob, how old are you? Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin? Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you. Wow. Oh, boy. Great. Great. That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride? Perfect. [starts closing the door] Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand] No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy. Good night guys. [staff leaves the office] I disagree, I think it was very valuable. I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it. Smell that. Do you smell that? No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer. Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later. Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food. Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today. I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back. With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like. Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class. OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy. Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship? Yes? OK, that's not helpful Phyllis. Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve. Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door] No, this is my quest. Fine. Then God speed. To both of us. We don't need luck. But thank you, that was really nice of you to say. Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people. It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith. I know. So who's next? Who? [places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps? Yes we do. Well... Mmhmm. OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch. Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket. Alright. [driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are? That is true. Yes, she is nuts. How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive. And the last guy says 'No, hairy body'. Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing? She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider. OK, OK! So you'll reconsider? Ah... .is that all you have to say? Look, we want you back. Well, no. No it's not. Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us. Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier. Great, the magic of the gift basket. OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic. I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing. That is a very good point, Dwight. No, it said right, it said take a right. Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right] The machine knows where it is going! The machine knows--- stop yelling at me! Let go, let go of me! [watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK? Good, that is what's most important. What a disaster, this whole thing. These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it. What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us. Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket! We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand! Give it back. The gift basket, give it back. Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch] Look, my clothes are so wet! It's been opened. What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles? WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY? May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now. Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake. I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me. Exactly! Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game. Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy. Yes.  My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation.  Very, very excited.  He is my protege.  He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured.  Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk.  And now he is also my boss.  So, win/win. Oh, Okay.  Okay.  Just...[Michael takes down banner, clears throat]  Well, our old friend Ryan Howard is back, and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company.  So please listen up. [awkward pause] All right. You don't want me to help? Yes? [laughs] Um... yes, I'll be right back! I think I know what's going on.  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now.  And there isn't.  But, um... don't tell him.  Don't tell him that.  I don't want to jeopardize our friendship. Ryan is causing some problems.  And you were always good at handling him.  What should I do to control him? I know, I know, no, what... something else. Uh-huh. Good. My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment.  Like... the moon landing.  Or Vietnam.  Rolling Stones.  Greatest band ever. And still rockin', Oscar.  One of the greatest all-time oldies was a little Oriental guy named Confucius.  He literally invented the ancient Chinese secret.  Here's some of his quotes.  Confucius say, 'Man who farts in church must sit in his own pew.'  Confucius say, 'Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day.'  Confucius also say, 'Virgin like balloon.  One prick, all gone!' No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious. I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See? BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  [drops BlackBerry on desk]  Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  [thinks] Apple. [nods] This is going on the outside.  The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner.  Do not tape those on. Mmhmm. I'm a little busy right now.  Could you BlackBerry me a message? [Creed is using the toaster as a mirror, and touching up his hair with a Sharpie and a comb] The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them.  And old enough to know the difference between the two.  I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls.  But old enough to know better.  I'm at a perfect age.  I could die now.  But I won't, because I am young. And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination. We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall] Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It's bland. Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle? Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a 'Where's Waldo.' [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen] [everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let's quit while we're ahead. That was awesome. Thank you. Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say? Oh, does he? Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you. And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches. Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen... The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight. No.  It doesn't.  I'll find out tonight. What's that, pipsqueak? Ohh, lunch party. Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway. Okay. Really? It's the European cut. Umm... hey.  Ah, what's hanging? Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7? I had um, one of those danishes. Why don't you wanna go tonight?  What... all your friends are gonna be there.  It'll be fun. Just... Yeah. Thank you. Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser. Do I have your permission to invite Carol? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  It's just the first... girl that popped into my head.  I'll find somebody I haven't slept with. So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins. Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good. Just let me know who the winner is. Alright.  I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun. Yes.  Thank you. Oh yeah, you'd better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.  [kissing noise, kissing noise]  I love ya Pam... okay.  [singing]  I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow I'll be back.  I'll be back.  Tomorrow.  Um... yeah.  So you know what?  Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight? If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow. You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham] Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured... Same sort of stuff in here. Mmwa.  Mmwa. Leaving Pennsylvania. One for me one for Jan. You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That'd be fun.  Friday? Wanna come over Friday? After work you guys... Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password.  So... What are you doing? No. No, I'm sure that's not.  Na... Yes. Well the invitation says VIP's only.  Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan?  We're already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I'm going to throw up.  I'm throwing up.  You're making me throw up, Ryan. You know what this is like?  I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go. Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us? Yeah.  I withdrew too. Alright who wants to party? Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out. I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton. Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come.  What's wrong with Dwight? Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good. This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home. How we doing on time? Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen. Mmmhmm. Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel. I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... Yes Uh... I want it... I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?' Yes you can. Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this? No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don't have a lot of time.  I'll get the pizza! Good news. Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo? Same thing. You know what?  I don't understand when you all talk at the same time. Pizza by Alfredo. Okay, okay, what's better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza? [sighs, walks back into office] Yup. You don't have to say it like that. Hey Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty. Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas. You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza? Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon. [sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um? It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story. I'm not giving that to you. No, no you're not going anywhere.  You're staying here until we figure this out. You know what?  This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people.  I don't care if it's pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room. Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you. No, you don't even know what stupid is.  It's about to get all stupid up in here. You ready to give me my discount now? Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time? Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man. No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay? Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that's called sales. Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse. Stop talking all at once! Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson? You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions. I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want. I think you're over-thinking it. Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our... Trouble.  Okay, alright. He said no. No, no. Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin? I'll just wave and introduce myself. Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole. Hey, have you seen Jim? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid. I could have paid for the pizza. Oh my God, oh my God. This is Michael. You're breaking up. I can't hear you. [to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent. I will open the door. And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands. Yes. See ya, drive safely. [pizza guy flips him off] Okay. Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens. Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time. What a horrible day. Bluh. Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I'd really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what? I'm going to get it. Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi. New York.  Wanna go? Alright, you drive. Here we go. Mmm. Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let's go. Guilty. Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer. Yeah. [mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face. I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot. I made it with my cheese pita. I started a fire, I started a fire. And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody... Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh. Wanna head back? What's wrong with me? I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. [Pam stares and nods]  Don't avoid this.  I know you're dying to say it, so just say it. What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light... The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things. Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do? Really? That's it? All right!  Martha Stewart!  You can be Martha Stewart's receptionist!  Very good!  I will be tea baggin' it.  Nn... no. [tea bags on eyes] Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to?  Not at all.  Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.  Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.  What are you gonna do? Coat! [throws coat at Pam] Steak! Where's my steeaaak? Get me Armani. On the phone. Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter] I owe you an apology. Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you. Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle. I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine. We already have a sofa. So why do--- It... folds up. You've only seen it flat. I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost? Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise. It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- [phone rings] Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man! Yes, and thank you for sending that to me. Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up. [looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it. Oh! Um, actually, I need the car. Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her. You can not, I have a thing tonight. What? Oh no, I have a thing tonight. How about this weekend? Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right. You wouldn't understand. It's a secret. I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy. I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing. Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call. No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars! These meetings are useless. Very inspirational. [laughter] Or a trained seal. [laughter] Yes, is Mr. Hudson there? I'm just calling because you responded positively to the--- ...Stanley? [Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your--- [speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television? Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly. You bet. Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes--- It is not a waste of our time. Vikram doesn't have my people skills. Well, I hope this conversation has helped. What did you get tonight? Oh, that looks good. I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening. Thank you. Really? Wonder what I would've been back home? I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something. I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy. You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator. I actually wrote a movie. I'm writing one, yeah. Um, sort of a spy, thriller... Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning. Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'? Okay. How's yoga? Wh-Why not? Okay. Good night Vikram. Hey, congrats on the bonus. I'm gonna have it one of these nights. Good night. Um... that wasn't much of an introduction. Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery. And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes. Why? No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that. My other boss, Mr. Figaro. What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'. It won't. Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs] Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it? Huh, okay. It's whoever, not whomever. No, whomever is never actually right. Not a native speaker. Well it sounds right, but is it? Thank you. No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull. I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history. Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company--- And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin. In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can't do this. I am. I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night. Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses. Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that? Do you know anybody in the mob? Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary. Hey guys. What'cha talking about?  [camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what's going on.  You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think--- Hey, hey, hey. Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems? Oh, I hate monkeys. I don't have a second job.  Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers. I don't talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual. I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket] Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore. No you didn't. How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose. That is a good point. Like the witness protection program. I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That's the life. I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY! I didn't say it, I declared it. Yeah, tell me about it. You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine. Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic. That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that's how they got a core. Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top. Right. How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point? No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this. We will find another way, we'll ask power-point. You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this. No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half. She poses. Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying? What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good. [singing] Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I'm never coming back. Hey Jan. Not much, what's up with you? I'm out of answers Jan. I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you. I don't know that. I'll stay off the grid. Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up. That's really nice of you to say. I think the engineer left. Don't sell your implants please. That's nice though. It looks cute though. I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'... Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could... [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight] What do you mean, 'what'? Were you listening to what I was saying? What is the matter with you? Yeah. Yeah. All right, well, go find some.  Get outa here, please. [Dwight sighs and leaves] Yeah.  What? Um, my CDs. I do. My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor [Oscar vigorously shakes his head]  What? I've been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn't even like.  No. [shakes head] I can't. I can't go back to that. I don't know if I can do that.  I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole. We will?  I can't.  I don't have an idea in my head. I have... Okay.  What?  Um... Tell me. Well, please?  I won't tell anybody. Yeah, I will. Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis! Dancing babies! I love it! I love it! We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby. Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else? Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good. Hello hello! Michael Scott. Regional manager. Excited to talk ideas. You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing. All right, good, well this is what we have to work with. I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out? He gives the best back rubs in the office. Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe. Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima. These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun. Who else? [reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison.  But we zoom back further--- Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so... Yeah, I know. Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background] That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa. Well we can do better than that. The waving? [on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry. Okay, calm down. I have a small problem. Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas. I'm creative, Ryan. Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store. Yeah! Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity. All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet. Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today. How about never hundred hours, sir. Hey thanks. Thank you. Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again. What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime. I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it. Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way. Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'? Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area. Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer. Line it up Phyllis. Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap. Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix. Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music. No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible. Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl. No. I said I hate the, the style. Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible. Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis? That'a girl. Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton? Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape] I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone] Pam, please clear my phone lines. They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God...I better call. [Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest! No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real. That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people! All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby? There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad. And that is probably why most ads suck. [points to the ad men waiting outside the conference room] Oh, that's them!  Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film. [everyone starts leaving the conference room] [loud whisper] Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best? About dressing your best today? Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it. Okay, good. Good. This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  [walking away]  Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going. And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean. So do, um, do sad, do the sad face. No, that's skeptical. Do sad. That's, that's a pirate movie. [Jim stares at Michael] That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure. And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let's get this movin'. [Dwight goes back to his seat, embarrassed] All right, let's start. You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free. Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate... ...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow. We start on a single blank sheet of paper. And we widen to reveal ancient Rome. Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb. Bull[censored] man! This is bull[censored]! Ahhhh!  [sweeps toys off his desk] If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk! No!  No!  Jim, Jim, don't, don't... No, I can do it. I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don't.  Please.  [kneels in front of desk] Please give me it. [taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed? Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh? I can't hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be... Okay, okay.  Who could do music? Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano. This is perfect. This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone. But, you will not tell anyone. Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  [knock on the door]  Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We're going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay? Just go out, and come back in. What? Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there. No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her. Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us? That could not possibly be it. You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming. How can I get you to stay? Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving. Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were- Pssh, kay. Fillipellers, how's it hanging? To the left? To the right? Okay, enough small talk, go ahead. Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this. No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby. You can train him.  He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours. Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up] Hi Ben, Michael Scott. I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend. [to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby. No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say? What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We're like Animal House. Jim, we're getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it. What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples. Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music? That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words. What? What? We did? Look at his face! Look at his face! What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing? We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing. Uh-huh. Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim. We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you. In your face Are you calling Karen? Yep, get it. It had to be done, it had to be done. Hey Dwight, he found it. Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever. Do you really wanna know? Follow me, come here.  Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs. No, no, not real bombs. Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know. It could be badass.  Yeah, it will. Teach her to offer Stanley more money. So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex? I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is... ...awesome. Okay, I will start.  Um, 'A.' [singing] 'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um... I'm trying to think of what we could sell. Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound...  The air-conditioning leaking or something? What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing? Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight! I'll kill you man! That is just so disgusting! Afro wig, do you want the afro wig? Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down.  You and I- You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place. [from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell. There's a guy, there's a guy. Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close. We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier. It's enormous, but it's got wheels.  We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running. Aha! [crashing] We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us. Save yourself! Dwight, you gotta move! Dwight, could you move over a little bit. Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim. Just say you wanna get back together. It doesn't have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies. [whispers] Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave] We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad. Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.  Big butt, bigger heart. [knock on the door] I can't do this. Of course. Really? Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys. Woo!  Shotgun! Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you. No, Dwight!  Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me.  You're gonna sit in the back left  where I don't have to see your ugly moongob. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dwight, you're handsome.  You're a very handsome man, get in the car. Dwight!  Stop it!  [moans]  Can you help me please, I'm being crushed. Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?  Like I begged you to?  Pam would have understood.  Heck, Pam would have done it. You embarrassed us. Morning. [from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up. Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real. So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go? Really? Oh, you wanna go today? How often can you actually donate blood? Your body only has a certain amount. Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame. A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands] Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself--- In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change. I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos. I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place. When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called 'Survivorman.' And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed. OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife. OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what... Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight. Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day. No. Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness. Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours. Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me. This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I. When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being. This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. Well, yes I would. And I would survive. Well... You... You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK. I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing? No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it. Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life? [flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug. [flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday! [flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday! [flashback to Phyllis' birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis' car] Happy Birthday! Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just -- Stop. Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight. Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug] Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off] [to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here... There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck]. I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat] See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things. Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable. I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter. Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious. I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy. Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day. Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth] Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something. Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. [shows off computer screen scenery] I can also make it the sky. Hey, buddy. What up? You are relieved. So what did I miss? Oh. Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out. That's what I said. That's what she said. I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard. Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward. Come in! Pam, are you my friend? We have been friends forever, right? Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you. Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate? So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip? Thank you for your honesty. Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there? Can you send Dwight in here? Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael's desk]  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please? Okay. All right, Dexter, just give me the knife. No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael]  All right. MmMmm.  All I need... No, Dwight! I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive. [holding up knife] What is this called again? I'll call back. [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says 'Good Morning'] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back. You can't always work 200 days though. [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed] Yep. Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later. N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude. I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist. Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy. Yeah, I hate that. So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs. Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy. Well- Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor. Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win. Million dollars! Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized. Perfect crime. Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good. I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up. Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff? Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is. Hey hey. I would love that. Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company. It is. Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here? Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition? Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves. Okay. All right. Yessh. Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior. I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief Six years and two months. That's what she said. That's what she said. Uh, wh-why would she say that? Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it. She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them. Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk. Yes. Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant. Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules. Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. [makes a gasping sound] I will allow it. Uh... Uh-huh. Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago. If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that. Line. Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary? Irie. I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary. [looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here? How can you give up my diary like that? How'd you even find it? I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this. Fine. I love you. Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend. Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful. Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that. That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... [Jan glares at Michael] ...of water. March 17th. Yes. [reading the performance review] 'I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs.' [stares at Diane, eyes tearing up] How can you do that to me? Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it. See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed. ...Absolutely not. Oh, hey no biggie. Just... [nods and shakes hands with David Wallace] Hey, David? I think you're a nice guy too. Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend. [Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner? Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap. Do you fast food? I have some, uh, experience.  I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case. Yes.  My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault.  [To Toby] Tell Meredith I said it another time [Toby nods]. Before we continue, I would like to make an opening statement. [clears throat and stands] Ladies and gentlemen of... the... table.  I would just like to say what a joy it is for me to be here today, but frankly, at my age, it's a joy to be anywhere [no one laughs].  I'm only forty-four, so I'm not old, and I guess that doesn't really play.  But the point is, I have a sense of humor.   And I implore you all to have a sense of humor as well.  Jan, David, my wonderful girlfriend [indicates Jan, then turns to David Wallace], my gorgeous company... Why don't we all just take a big deep breath... and just relax [breathes in deeply, no one responds].  Good.  That feels good [sits].  All right.  Everybody feel better? Na, Na-oh, Naa-es. Ye-ohh.  Ye-no. Very nice! [Borat voice] High five! [Borat voice] [shakes head] Can't stop. Forgot normal talk. Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight? Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday. All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there. I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks? You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said. Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy. Hello. Come on in. Good to see you. Yes I would. So, what have you been doing? Yeah. Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing. Except driving. Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa. Okay. Totally your call babe. Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door. Well, thats... Yep, never been used. No. This is it, check that out, can you smell that? [the room is filled with candles that say 'Serenity by Jan'] As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here. Bond. James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue] Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color. Well, I- Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy. It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down] I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall. Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table. No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry. If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away. Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies. I'll get it. Okay. Very nice. When in Rome. Whatever you say babe. All right. How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends. Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth. Yeah that sounds good. You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him. All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn. Yes, I was watching Jim's face. And he was laughing. Look at him, he's laughing. Well you don't need two of you to do that. That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right. All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom- All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE. No, Baah! But he's married to her! No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger. Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator. No! God, does anybody read the paper?! You're welcome. I don't like that story babe. Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible. Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me! [in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles. Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of 'Serenity by Jan' What do you think about that? I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now? Dwight is my friend. You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person. Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see? When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children. Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away] [leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food. I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe. You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that? Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table] Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay. Everybody enjoying their meal? Yeah? No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together. [to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good. BFD. I'm a screenwriter. NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS! MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES! OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER! [yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.] You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon. Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party. Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma. Would she get into trouble? I will take the fall. I did it. Jim? Pam? No. Nope. My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room. Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn't really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray] [touching and moving each amuse-bouche] They need to be presented... royally... anyone? Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking. It's been a rough couple of weeks. Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift. Yes. So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog... And the neighbors blamed Jan. It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds... So... Well. Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. [holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman? Hmm... Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch. Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women? I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands. What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results. Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings] I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all. [to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up? I thought that you were engaged? Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends? Oh... Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright. [sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm... What? Oh. Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer? Oooo. Catcher or in field? Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her? I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question. Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK! What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry. Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes. Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear 'Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.' No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired. Hmm.. Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad. That would be bad. Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't. What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves. Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards. Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. [Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.] Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael. Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please? [under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please? Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready. Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah. Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model... That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go. She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young. Oh, God. Oh... Try not to be so hurtful Jim. Please, not at a time like this. [sighs] Oh really? What's her name? Burger King? I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot? No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again. [while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families. [still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now. [to cashier at coffee shop] Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette [cut to a blonde woman in a skirt]. Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. [woman walks right by and doesn't respond] [turns around to see the woman from his description] Ugh. Is who a Michael what? Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK... So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What... Just making conversation. Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us? You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that. Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know. Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus. Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves] Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me? Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office] I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs] You're right. What do you mean though? Hmm. [looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die? God. She was so innocent. You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do? Oh, you move on. [singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die? Return. This'll be [with Dwight] the day that I died. It is moving day.  I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um [Dwight puts his fingers to his head and makes a shooting noise] ssp... No, I did not kill her.  We were just at different places in our lives.  No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.  She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale.  Fresh outlook, and it's all good. Oh.  What is this? You were charging me?  I'm your friend. There was no other guest the entire time I was here. Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.  The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.  Just ring me up.  Go ahead [Dwight tears up bill]. Thank you, Dwight. Dwight, little help with the bags, please. So, what about you, Angela?  Do you have any single friends? A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or... No, no, obviously older. Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI. [sitting at her desk] Hey, Kelly. Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends? Yeah? That's hilarious.  What's her number? Mmm... nah, that's too young. Oh. ['Rita Klondike 507' is written on an index card] All right, time's up!  Pencils down.  Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward. Pammy? You don't have one single girlfriend? I'm not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.  Just fun, healthy young woman. A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain? How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side? You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model.  I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There's face models, hand models, body models [Jim raises hand] - yes. Really? No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim. Send me a picture. So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It's a start. I got gum in my hair. This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it. OK, let me be. I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil. Kill me... right now. I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich. Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about. Smells good. Oh don't. That's disgusting. Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice. [sighs] I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness. Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or... Yeah. [slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good. Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend. Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan] Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me. Na? Well you tried. Yeah. They sound great. Would you have sex with Meredith? Do you think she'd keep it quiet? Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that... Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan. Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome. Who you dating? That's still going on? Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls. Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift. I am going to go get laid. Goodbye. That's... I, I think that... Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative. Place is packed. Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall. No, they're just hotties. Hey. Hey! Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada. Alright! Yeah. Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight. Ok. Well. Alright! Let's do it! Hey, nice to meet you. Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour. Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries. I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting 'Back to the Future.'  'Back' because it's on my back and 'Future' because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie. Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course. Forty... I'm in my forties. Nuhh... Oh, OK. You are welcome. This place is like sexy pre-school. I would love a place where we could meet older Ahh, wow. That's dangerous. You're kidding. I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool. I am a bank teller. Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance. I think so. Yeah, I have fun. All right. Very perfect. [girl walks away, Michael laughs] Oh my [notices Dwight making out with Tall Girl #1] This needs to be shared. [takes a picture with his camera phone] [Cut to the office - All Office co-workers cell phones go off. They notice the picture Michael has sent and all groan] She washes dogs. I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom. Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy] Hmm... [on phonne] I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... [Ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over] Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls. [Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad. Well... Pretty weird. [Dwight and tall girl run out of club] Let's go. I know, here we go. This is it. This is where the magic happens. Very nice. Dwight, I'm the boss. Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on. Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone. Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off. Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it. Best night ever. Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys. You're gonna be okay, it's gonna... Ahh, ooh! [helping Ryan out of the taxi] Come on, come on. Here we go, let's sit down. All right, shhh.  Dwight, leave him alone. You had a rough night tonight.  But your life is very good, my friend.  You've got a great job, you... you can have any woman you want, you're good looking, you, you know... Frien..sss...yes, you're friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live.  I mean, you've got it all. No, I mean this apartment building, it's fantastic. Well, now I can say that I went to a museum. Ryan? Do you ever miss us? Ryan? Do you remember what color my eyes are? Dwight, I asked him. Really? Not just because he said it? Ryan? Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on! Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write? M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't... Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go! Here we go! Let's, yes? Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it! It's drying, it's drying... Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl! Ahh come on! No! No! No!! Come on, gimme something good! Pam, translate. I love it! I love it more! I... love it!! Haha, come on! [with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please. [muffled] That's what she said. Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, 'That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole...' I dunno, it's a good feeling. All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction... Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room. Ener-gize... Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy? Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim? Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme... An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley... Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group. Stanley, we're havin a little... We're havin a little brainstorm session... ...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water. Ugh, what? What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened. That? In the conference room? We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said 'did I stutter,' and I said 'wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?' It was joking, Toby, alright? Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: 'Hey um, you're poor.' 'Well hey, you're mama's dead.' That's what friends do. It's... you're so white. Mmhmm. Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but... Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological. I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal. Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool. Uh huh... Great What's the pink? Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this? Other than me. I never said you could do that. I... Okay, I will think about it. No. Hey. Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang? It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um... I know, it's very, very personal... I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods? God. Okay. Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you. Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right? What is that? Really? I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other. Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him. It's like a mock execution. Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left. No, okay... I've had enough of you. Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay? I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. [Stanley enters the room] Stanley, may I talk to you for a second? Stanley Hudson, you are fired. I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack. Hmm. Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice. That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me? Okay... Yes. That's not- All right, all right... Okay. Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out. Everybody, except Stanley. [starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me. You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand. Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well. All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it. I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, 'I don't respect you!' Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect! So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley? Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis. You know, I don't care what he did to me.  He's mean to other people, that's what gets me.  He's just... Everybody.  He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me. Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts. Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is... And that Angela's a midget, and that [indicates Jim] your chin is too big. I know, I know.  I think it's tiny.  I think it's too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly. Well, he's just mean. It's complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk. Okay. I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble... jerk stand. Pam, stand up. Pretty disgusting. Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited! Yeah, I'm pretty excited too. Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place. Yup. Why are you dressed like that? Like you're applying for a loan. Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college. Let's go! [Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think? This is all we need. Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign]  Hello! Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me. Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, 'only the best and the brightest.' He's totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey. How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby. Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately. Are you mental? I... don't. And that. Is why. I need a smart intern. [teen approaches table] Hello there. Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company... Dammit, Oscar! Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being 'lured' these days. Thank you Dateline! [answers cell] What do you want? Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there? Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this? This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap. Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock. Yes. And don't call me Shirley. All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck. Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar's ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling] [singsong] Just-in time. Just-in case. What's your last name? This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh? Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now. I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin. This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will 'do' you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know? Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist. So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special. No, I didn't. You misconstrued me. I, uh, hmm. Why don't... hey. Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe. Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me. [standing way too close to Jim and Pam] Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. [Jim and Pam stop kissing] Well, kids today have a very short attention span.  They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.  And today they're being distracted by the other booths. [clears throat] Hey, there!  Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin. That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there. So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like... Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you. Right here.  We have a lot of fun. [Pam returns] This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly, [takes piece of paper from Pam] receptionist extraordinaire. Check that out, huh? Pretty nice. She sits there all day. You get to look at her.  Why don't you hold out your hand. [hands Brad paper] Tell me what you feel. That's called card stock.  That's what you're feeling.  Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, 'Am I good enough for this job?  Do I have what it takes?'  And I think we both know the answer.  We'll find that out together.  You can keep that. Mmm, yeah. Don't fold it, though. We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it's sexy, it's sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?  The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom.  So.  [to Pam]  I've been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?  [Pam shakes head no]  So, sexy is fun... Hey, you know what?  Coincidence - I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer? Yeah, me, too. Okay, be my guest. And do your worst. [to Brad coming out of the bathroom] Hey. So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this... One other thing I wanted to... [laughs]  Ohh...Nah. Hey, Justin! Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force? Time out.  You think this kid could be a fighter pilot? Okay. Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin? Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure.  The brochure is up here [indicates head] and it's in here. [indicates heart] I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high. I'm right. Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days. Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps] First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party. Okay. Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets... If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have? Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga- Toga! I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe] Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. 'Michael, buy a motorcycle.' So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now. I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around. Phyllis, can you do this? [watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow. Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already. Why do you hate her? You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me. Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do? We need to sell her an elevator pass. Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing. [knock on door] Yeah. Oh, hey, do you still work here? Nah. No. I think I will pass. Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win. Yeah. T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness. Y-You can-Michael. Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet. Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram? I bet. I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off? Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in? You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player? All right. Yep. [listening to 'Crash Into Me' on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P... Music... For a CD mix tape... For Holly. And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels. The two levels being, uh, 'Welcome to Scranton'... And 'I... love you.' Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2? I think I do. Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears. Well, you're not a romantic. Oh really? Like, with who? Pam? Yeah, you took it too slow. This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me. I don't want her to get away. Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually. And the sequel, 'Woman Stands at Desk and Works.' So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that. [as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um... So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town. Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting! [overdramatically] Acting! Yeah. I did it! [exhales] I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point. It was hard. I wanted to kiss her. Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base... [giddy] Yeah... Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party? Yes we do. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'. Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend. Hey! Hi, good to see you. I'm just having a little exit interview. Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler? Okay. Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are? Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right? Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see. Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin? Well, no no no no no... No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud. [hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll kill you. Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which... What the hell is that? That's... What do you mean, 'Michael'? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?! No! Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby. My gift is forthcoming, Pam. I am going to give Toby... ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that? How did you know? Well... That's my watch. Hey, that's good. [still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God. [voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend. Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run. I'm cool. Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level. No antigravity machine, huh? Ferris wheel's pretty cool though. That's what she... a lot of places are like that. Thanks. I like, uh... Hey. What are you doing? What the hell is going on here?! There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight! Why did you do that? No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right? Shh... I'm really sorry. Yeah... Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! [giggles] [on microphone] Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh? Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter. I have done things like um, 'Beers in Heaven.' Or, 'Total Eclipse of the Fart.' I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, 'Goodbye Stranger'? Supertramp? [sings] It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on. [singing] Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise... [singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by! Oh, hey. Thanks. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy. Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back. What is it? Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me. Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back. O-kay. Hello Jan. Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here? Oh, okay. Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly] Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous? Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you? Good. Good. Thank God. Cause that's... Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy... Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very... ... proud. Um... You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to? Well, okay... So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so... You did? When we were going out? W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms. You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm? IHop. I'm glad you told me. Um, I'll... I have to think about it. My whole life, I have known two things: I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other. Hey. Yeah? Oh, wow. Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh... Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there. Have a good night. Bye. Well this is it. I am here to see you off. Sorry. Corporate policy. You might take something. Okay, security guard. Okay. [on phone, leaving a message] Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. [hangs up] I am going to be... kind of a daddy. Oh, my God. Toby Flenderson, come on up here. Come on, no, no, no. Toby! Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it.  It's very funny and charming and heartwarming.  And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.  [laughs] No!  So, take it away, Toby!  Whoo! Ach, [to Darryl quietly] okay, okay, play the cutoff music. Blah, blah, blah, blah... ...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!  Let's keep it moving!  Let's keep it moving!  Toby, everybody! All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. [cheering] This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days. Dwight, Dwight! No, I will ex-squeeze you. OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays. Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only. Jimbo. Did you see Holly's butt? Why? I know. I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read 'Lonesome Dove' three times. And that her butt refuses to quit! [follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane. I thought you had to pee. [sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey! [frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it? No. OK. Um, the last word is 'seagulls.' I took a lot from other poems. All right, call-- [leans in to kiss Pam] OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week. Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go. All right. All right! [rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat! Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. [to Jan] Come on. Let's go in. No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you! Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day. Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please? Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go. OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts. Damn it. Come on. Here we go. Everybody on. How's it going? Good. Cake? Who suggested cake? [Angela points to Phyllis] Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis. What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years. Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country? No. Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose? Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds? If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this? This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing. Booty call. Here. Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me. You want more? [music playing] It's a pretty lame party. You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them. Let's go mini-golfing. Uh... Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time. You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early? Yeah. Good luck. Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her. OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit? And what is that? You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing. Ronnie was bleh.  Things were at an all time sad here.  But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town.  And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard.  Give him to me.  I want him.  I need him. I did! Yes.  Gooooo-tee! Hey, you know what?  I can't do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. [flails his arms] [groans painfully] [struggling to speak] Mmm--- mmm...  Um... Close the door.  This is your fault. Your stupid friend zone. I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh---  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man! Mmm-hmm.  Saunas. Gah, the dreadmill. [both laugh] [in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody! I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma's House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful. It's my sumo suit.  I just didn't inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented. Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society. If it's me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, 'Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?' How do you know Michael Clump? How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people. No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside... and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man. Hey!  Why don't you just sit down, please? We're doing this because of you.  So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved? Why? Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march. Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first. You're right, you're right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok. Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why don't you have a seat?  [Phyllis sits] Let's all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok!  [in Michael Clump voice]  When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.  [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him]  Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her.  She's a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful? Ok, be more specific. What about her looks? Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself? I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.  [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm. Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers. Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee] Oscar, enough with the girl talk please. Hey! Excellent!  Good job. Yeah, oh, hey.  Did he call? No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call? I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He'll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he'll call.  If he doesn't, he is loco. Ugh. Wait, do we have until the end of the day? [Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food? We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please? Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok? Aww, really? I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing... ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot. I know.  I love Counting Crows. Wow, really? That's a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you. I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do. Ok? Alright.  Alright!  [tears up tickets]  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so... Is that good? OK. Darryl, would you do the honors? Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don't care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers. No, you know what we're gonna do?  We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition. Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal. Hey, Oscar!  Come on, let's go! I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year. Okay, no, I am not.  Dwight! [Dwight runs into Michael's office]  I want you to take Jim's chair.  No!  No!  His chair at his desk.  He gets it back on Friday. I want you to get your ass out of my face. [from his office] That's what she said. Well... You're...you know what?  I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor. I'm digging. I can't wait to be a father.  I'm going to smother that baby. I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please... I know, it's... Yes. I want you to get the panty liners. [walking in] What's going on? [to Jim] To be married? WOO!  Alright! Why are you helping her?  You're not even dating.'  She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh... Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps] [clapping] Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy. Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps] [to Holly] Can't set 'em up like that. Can we have a moment?  [whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic. Yeah. Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan. Do you... just... you're kind of losing them. [coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils. I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry. Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on. I will go first.  When I discovered To tell you or not.  And I'm glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity. Yeah, [interrupting gibberish].  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly. A siesta! You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah? Who hasn't?  Good.  Good!  What else? Mmm... Well, let's keep this party movin' on. Bruuuuuuuuuce. Ach! Wuh--- That's crazy.  That's crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got? [checks watch] You know what?  That's a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Who's to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, let's give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate. Oh... Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around. No... no, this is just a stupid formality. Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk. Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You'll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out. Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch? Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.  [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses]  Sorry!  You know what?  Let's go out!  Dunder Mifflin's treat.  Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it?  Ethical. What do you think?  What do you think of this place? Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines? Wow, that sounds so... warm. Here too.  You know what my favorite season is? Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons. Wow, terminator, terminator. Yeah. I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money. Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her. Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months. I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key. No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the... I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying. Yes. Well... bleh busted.  I don't... Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family. I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash] What's the only thing worse than one HR rep? You get me. I don't know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man. Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar. How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, 'I told you so.'  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way. Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you. Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room] Now is really not the time, Meredith. Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan? Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay? What do you need? I... really want to keep you. Wait, what? Nnnngah! Yeah. OK, just remember to keep breathing. OK, good. Oh, OK! OK! I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital. I take Quincy Ave to Gibson. I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby. [annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby? All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go! Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out. Aaaaaaaa! Just keep pushing... I'm right here. I'm right here, I'm right here. [annoyed] All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe. Shhh. No, you can't have it.  It's too late. No.  You have to just push it out! Keep simulating. OK! Keep simulating. Yes, I do! OK. Yes. Aaaaaaaa!  It's coming!  Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that? Nice touch.  Good.  Let's try that again. [eating the watermelon] It is going to be the happiest day of my life. [Dwight gets dressed behind Michael and zips his fly] Hello ladies, how's my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks? Damnit, Phyllis!  I'm sorry.  [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments? She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So... I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis? It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens. [banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them. Make the party.  Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. [Phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump] Pump it! Ahoy, matey. Ahoy. So, how you doin'? Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  It's all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And I'm treating Ryan the same way. So this is Astird. Oh, OK.  Why didn't you call me? I could have helped. Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways. No, I don't! Can I hold her? [cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK. I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion. [carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst... ...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You're going to know them for the rest of your life. [looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King! OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop. [sees Jan sizing up Holly] I'm fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in. Ready to play some games? Let's do it! Uh, duh. No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let's just do what you were going to do. All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes. Whatta we got? Oh! She already has a stroller. OK, what else? Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this. I could have helped. [smiling] Uh, yeah. [voiceover] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged. Phyllis?  Could you take-. Hey guys. Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another. Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby? I just saw this baby daddy- Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote? Well- It's- that's different. That's not a baby. [sighs] Could I? [sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt. Sure you can't stay a little longer? All right.  All right, everybody, we're leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving. OK? Wha - that's, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine. All right. [just hugs her, and she hugs him back and smiles] You wanna go out? I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly. Oh! OK! Seventeen.  I say seventeen squares. Do the boobs! Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please.  Very rude.  You're ruining the party. Hey. That was really fun last night. I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs. Yeah? Oh really? Well... I, uh... [to camera] I let her win. So, when, um, can I see you again? No. Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out. [concerned] Why? Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight... Tonight's so... Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day. You're welcome. In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure. Yeah. Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight? Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first. Probably get soup or something light. No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy. Do you need 'em? All right. Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing] Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all. We're totally alone. Oh, my God, what happened? Yeah. Oh... oh! No, did you? Oh, no, my God. Oh my God! So much for sex without consequences. We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright? To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty. Thank you. Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own? Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days. I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here- Do I? Yeah, I think that's pretty boss. Whoa! Twice. ... Right? Mm-hmm. Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. [music stops] And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. [clears throat] Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed. [cheers and applause] It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars. [auctioneer voice] 300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400-[speaking gibberish] Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450 [speaking gibberish] Sold! For 300 dollars to me! [bangs gavel, which squeaks] What the hell is that? It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price! Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of- Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says 'Creed.' Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man. Federal and State. [no one bids] Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage. We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. [David Wallace walks in] Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo! Hey! 100 dollars, great. Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter. 160 Uh, just a few more items. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. [cheering] All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around? No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody. Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so. She's your wife, you idiot. Uh, what the hell is happening? 300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice. 300 and one penny, 300 and one penny. 325, 325. 350 350 and one penny. 400, 400 hey batter batter. 400 and one penny. 500 500 and one penny. One million dollar! 700 Humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna- 1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done. [whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth] Oh, I guess that job that I got you is working out for you well, then. Hey, if there's anything else I can do, just let me know. You know what?  I would love a slice of real New York style pizza. Even as pie. [opening a delivery envelope, takes out slice of pizza which appears to have a section off the end] Okay... don't ask me how I got it, let's just say that I have... connections. [folds it in two and takes a bite] Mmm.  Mmm.  [with a full mouth and an Italian accent] I'm the Godfather.  I'm gonna eat this whole pizza.  And then I'm gonna kill you. [digs around in envelope, pulls out the rest of the slice] [indistinct] some cheese.  You gotta fold it up.  That's the way you eat pizza. I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating. I have two sure things, one wildcard. Okay. The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant. Exactly.  Here, here are my sure things.  I blindfold her.  I take her to the Houdini Museum.  She chains me up... Okay. All right. Number two, we go to the mall... We go to the bed store, I let her choose whatever bed she wants... And we have sex on it. Really?  I don't know.  It's a big third date, Jim. What do I do? Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision. Times have changed, Jim. Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets. When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire. Road trip!  Right? Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again. We're not. We're not doing anything. All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge. Ah, you are quite the gentleman. You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want. Cool! We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song. Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare. Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting? All right. What's the scoop, how far? Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast. Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon. Here we go, fourth time's a charm. 'Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying? Allergies? Did Darryl touch you? What's the matter? Sure it is. Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine. Listen to me. I like you so much. And I've dated four women in the last-- Not last - no. In like the last ten years. I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid. That's what she said. Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be. Yeah. Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way. I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road. Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend? Years! Yeah. Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy. My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy. You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well.  We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think? Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. [they continue arguing] I don't know what I'm gonna do! Please? I'm not gonna be okay. No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God! Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck. You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you. I'll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly? So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye. We didn't break up. Okay. That's a really pretty song. Okay. Okay. Da  na na na na. Da  na na na na. Da  na na na na. Da  na na na na. Da  na na na na!! [deeper] Da  na na na na. [deeper] Da  na na na na. [blues singer] Da  na na na na... [talking head] This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I've decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks. [playing cat's cradle with Holly] Okay, am I grabbing this one? [laughs] Fair enough. Okay, okay. What kind of car games did you play in the 'hood? Cow surfing? Really? Cow surfing. [spots a cow out the window] Okay, here we go, there's a cow. Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. [throws up hands] Pull it over. Here we go. [reaching to open door] I'm gonna do it. The man has a point. [visibly shocked] What? Why? [gasps] I do! Hey, come on! Jackson Five. [rubbing noses with Holly] You're the one. You are. No, you are. You're the best. You're better. You're better than my best. Here we go. Okay, Ready? Watch this. Darryl, watch this. Yeah Yeah. Right, snuggle time. [makes squeaking sounds] Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up. We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours. Speak. Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well. Come on, it'll be fun. [emerging from convenience store with two ice cream sundaes] Hey, look at that. Fun, right? Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing. Say what you said. [laughs] I'll save you! I'm Superman! Scooperman! I didn't ask. We want the same things. That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs. Seven deadly sins. It's a sign. [standing with Holly next to 'Welcome to New Hampshire' sign] Oh, it's really cold here. Yeah. [starts to cry] Can we have another? I think I blinked. Oh, you have your own entrance. That's nice. Hey, sport. Ow! God! No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam. Yeah, so there you go. Oh, wow, so quickly. Nope. Nope. Not yet. I'll call her later. I don't want to do that. [chanting continues] All right. [picks up phone and dials] She is going to freak out! That's -- thanks. Mom, I'm getting married. Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me. No. [laughs] I'm not, I'm not getting married. So... [laughs] Psych. And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys? I'll take care of that for you. [crumples receipt and throws it in trash] Thanks. Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. 'Schindler's List' parody. ... That's not appropriate, no. Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did. No. Wow. Dwight, your feedback is horrible. A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful. No, no, no, no, no. Do I look like I am joking? If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing? You're not. Jimbo, let's do this thang. Oh, come on. You too? Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth] No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It -- I agree. So let's see what we can find out from reading. [reads] Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant. [points at Jim] Arrogance. And there's our smudgeness. Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called? Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go. [whispers] Ask him his name. Be respectful, Dwight. It's up to you to change his mind. Boundaries, Dwight. Come on! He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go. Stop it! Stop it! That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client. Here we go. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager. Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you? [covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it's done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did? Yes. ... [whispers] It's a million-dollar sale. Why don't you tell us? Dwight. [to Kelly] I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate. What's going on? [looks momentarily flattered, but thinks better of it] Kelly. You cannot say 'I was raped' and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened. Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people. You were lying. Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us. I will call you when it is time. [Jim and Dwight leave] I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry? I think you should do that. [Kelly starts fake-crying, then laughing, then she and Michael both laugh] How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger. And she took a bite, started to choke. So what do I do? I have CPR training. Go around, start doing the Heimlich. The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming 'Opa!' Which means 'congratulations,' so... I'm pretty much devastated. Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself. Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.' Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael's office smiling] I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them. Attention, all problem sales persons. Jim Halpert... Dwight Schrute... Intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch. That is all. Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?  In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.  In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  This is considered to be polite. I am jetting off on an international business trip. To Can-A-da. Canada. My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international.  The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery... Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi. I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith's face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture. I have my passport. [pats jacket pocket] I have my per diem. [holds up money] I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater. Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that. And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce. Well that is all in the past. They have one of those? [in a singsong voice] Lets do this! Two are for souvenirs. I do. It's right here. [indicates to waist] No, I don't want to wear a bra. Stop it! Stop it! Okay.  Where is my translator? There he is. Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn't forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man? There we go. Our town car awaits. Its not just a van. Dwight, can you get those please? [on airplane] Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa. Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet. Take a sip of that. [hands Andy his mimosa] That good? Don't drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar. You want one of your own? I can hook you up. Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning. Yes... Get back, get back.  Come on, get back to the slums. [whisper] Hey... guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies. Shhhh! Keep it down. Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? [Andy laughs] My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much. [to stewardess] Hi. Um. I'd like to see a menu please. Oh... okay. [looks back at Andy and Oscar] Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap.  I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold.  I will don it... and oh! Look at that.  I can't see because I am in a-- [cart crashes into Michael's leg] GAH! [going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet... ah. Alright. Very cool. Okay. Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those. Wow! Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you! A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered. Guys, she's in there. Let's do this. [goes up to concierge from the hotel] Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again. Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez. Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie... ...who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight. And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night--- She's foreign.  I am-- Oh, thank you. Thank you, Andy. Everyone is going to end up dying someday.  And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with. How about this one? It's Christmas eve--- ---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do? Unbelievable! Unbelievable. [standing outside hotel room... whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something? Okay. Slept like a baby. Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs] Yes. Yeah, we locked him up for two years. No. Actually the trip sucked. The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip. I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van. And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time. It was not, it sucked. Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was--- that was a--- That was a really good choice. No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man. That was a really sucky thing to do. Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.  I think it's because they respect me.  A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.  That's respect. Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier. Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica? Heh, okay, weirdo. She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing] Yeah, they used to. Oh, can you imagine? Uhhgh. I don't know.  What? Hmmm, dare I? [laughs]  You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.  [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby] NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO! [watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No. No. He looks worse. Uh, well I'm afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance. Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David. Yes. I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened. I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved. That's true.  People say it's icky. David, wait. Is there no way we can get rid of him? I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him. No. I don't. [Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that. You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again. You're welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family. So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun. Nice beaches, pristine beaches? Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay? I bet, for you. [shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself. Yeah, I am.  I am. I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.  I feel like I'm dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them. Okay, just summarize. That's it, that's it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act. Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started. What are you doing? For what? No, no, no. You're the bait for Toby? No, for one thing, he's not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me. Yes, sure they do, Dwight. Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please. Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam. Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me? Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't. Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word. Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them? Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter?  What's the matter? You scared? You mad? You mad at me? Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me? Huh?  He might do it... I dare you to.  Come on. What's the matter... haaaww! Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on? No do it, do it.  I dare you. Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon... Son of a bitch. [mouth full of brownie] Just stop it.  You haven't done anything helpful all day. What's that? Frame him? I've never framed a man before, have you? Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean. Hello.  I've seen you guys around.  I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here?  I need to purchase something. No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some... Grass, weed? I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt. I'm not wearing a wire, so... How much? How many pounds is it? Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot... Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder what's going on. [follows them] Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding. Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay? No, no no no... No, no. No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate. Oh God! No, no no no no. God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that! Ahh, that's mine. Yes, it's mine. Are you kidding me?  That's my salad. You must feel pretty good about yourself right now. Hmm. Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere. Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face. You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So... Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history. Do you want to hear a lie? I think you're great.  You're my best friend. Mmm... okay. Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old. Yes. There's the x-ax...icks. Mmhmm, okay. Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five. Ho-oh! Yeah. I'll be six. So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus. [whistles poorly] Whoo. Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you... Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess? No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better? So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good? Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one. Alright, so, teams forming. You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex. Yes. Why me? Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end. Yes. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing. Yes. Ohh, God! Yeah! Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! All right! Cool! I have no idea. [through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me? Yeah. Yeah? Oh, hey. I do. it was fun. We had a good time. Oh, thank you. Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars. You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars. Nine dollars. The boys' department. Look at the ass. Check out the ass. Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh. Yes they were. They were. Mmhmm. Sits on a copier. Yeah. Very valid. All right. See ya. [laughs] Hahaha!... well... Okay. Oh, thank you my dear. Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay... There he is! Hello, hello! Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you. Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah! Hey hey! Yeah! Unh! Oh... ah, I almost choked. Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads. Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want. Yes. Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand- Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs. It is, yes. What? Okay. Oh, there we go. Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party. So, the copier. All right, yes. Well, what should I do? All right, get out. Get out. Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now. No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry. Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different. No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy. The what now? ...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?! I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king. All right, attention everyone. I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly. Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing. Do I know what? Mm, no... $645.00 Right. Because that is how my mind works. Let's see... I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less. This is so stupid. This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone. To be continued! No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me. [groans in frustration] You think it's easy? Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right? It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey. What? Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother- [wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory. Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party? Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever. Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out. Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky. This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything. Alright... One more time around the block. Jim, Jim.... That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka. Yeah. I know. [sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India. Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth No, no. I celebrate privately. Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly. We'll do it quickly. [mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it-- Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up. An intervention.  It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop. Okay, how do you feel? Uck... T.M.I. Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party. I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic. Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand] The aye's have it. Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket] Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind? Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday? Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church? I got it on a website, that's not important. Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting? Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin. That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that. Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything? Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night? Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do. I want you to say I'm an alcoholic. You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you. [amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead? Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out. Dwight-- [sighs]...okay. Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help. You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice. [whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned? We did? Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess. We could go there, sure. Yes, yes. I have a new place. It-- yep, recently. All right. Yeah, oh there you go. That's good. We're party girls. It's okay. It's all right. Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on-- Here we go. This is gonna be good. Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car] Shhh... just calm down. [chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh... Here's the door. Here's the door. [dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you? I have a deposit.  Alcoholic. So do I sign? As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan. [heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis! No. No, no. There was wind. Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over. I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one! I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number. Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number. Beat it! Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad. Wait, you still don't know... You still don't know. [to Jim] What are you doing? Andy. [from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is... No, that's not it. [sighs] How can he still not know? I can't take it anymore. I am telling Andy. Who should it come from, then? [to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'] Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'] Well? You know this can't go on. We have to put an end to this. Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael's office] When will she be ready? Is she crazy in bed? How so, specifically? Really? It's too late. I am already walking. Okay, what does that mean? [sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it. Thanks. [to Andy] Andy? Walk with me. Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear... Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day. Which will be fine. I am off! Thank you! [gets into his car] [through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so... [rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know. All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh. Yep. [drives off] Right what? David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever. Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation. This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler. [pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta? So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, 'Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?' And he looks at me and he says, 'Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.' And I look back at him and I say, 'I feel the need!... The need for tweed.' [rises] Oh, thank you. I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me. Okay. [sits back down to continue eating] Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh! What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis] Hi, I am well, how are you? Oh, have you not? Yeah. Okay. Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur? Oh, well, then, email it to me. I will seduce her. No, I will seduce her. No, I got it. Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support. Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies Michael Scarn. Okay. [interrupting] No. No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP. Oh, don't start, You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP. You will have pancakes and you'll like it. So what? Maybe they are shrinking. They could be shrinking. Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup. Mm hmm . And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business. Argh, why are you all... Shut up. Ready to do this? Good. Here come the sharks. [they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead] In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business. Hello. My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company. Thank you. We are a law firm. You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have? Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation. Ah, so when did you set up shop? Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely . So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock? Well that is... because... I am a genius. Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession. Try 80. Hey, hey, how is your interview going? Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you? I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture] What's going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right? Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4? Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives] Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision. I... Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal] Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time. I cannot wait to contact your clients. Haha, we struck the mother load! Wallace is going to freak. He's going to absolutely freak. Oh shoot. Oh God, what was that? Aw, it's alright. Aw, my car. No no, we are fine. You have done enough already. Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so... No, no, really not necessary. You know let me give you some money for this. Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it] Thank you. Ok, goodbye Prince Family. Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information? Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine. Why don't we just, live and let live? Live and let live. It's from James Bond. I'm not going to make this call. My heart says... That is true. That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times. Jan... Ryan. You're right. You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info. Just something I have to do first. Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows] Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around] Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door] Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people. Im not a shark. [pained] Mpfh. Thank you. Okay, bye bye. I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping? Oh, hey what is this? Oh, she is hot. ['Hillary Swank is hot' supporters cheer] Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm. Stay [bleep] calm! Everyone, now [bleep] calm down! What does warm mean? Don't run. Get out of the way! Go, go, go! Okay, we're trapped.  Everyone for himself. [throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!! No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth. He's going to swallow is tongue. Open your mouth.  Come on. Don't swallow it. Leave me al-- Saving him! Electricity. Hed. Hedded Take hedded of. Heed. Heed. Take heed of. Take heed of. Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed. Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide. I am not a mind reader, David. And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn't like. Do you? You talking to me? What? [sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man. Yes. I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out. No, I will. Nobody should have to go to work thinking, 'Oh, this is the place that I might die today.'  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true. Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley. Andy. No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet. Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.' Shut it.  Shut it. We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket. You know who I really think should go? Stanley. Come on. No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops? And you're okay with that? Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this. Come on Stanley.  You're losing you.  You're losing you. Do it! This is you we're talking about. Okay, okay.  I'll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley.  All right. No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs. Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there? How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything. okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour? I will divide and then count to it. Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified. Okay, I got it. Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive [Andy joins in] Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive. Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah... He is an organ donor. Yeah. Hey, Stanley. Are you okay? Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy? Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person. Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret? Let's hear it. [in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm... My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice... [everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance. And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out. Too expensive. Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones. Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game? You have stress? During our relaxation exercise? No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go. Let me getcha. Ok, alright. Ok. [beeping slows down] Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot. Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer] So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist. I don't get it. Do I stress you out? Oh... Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge. Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short... What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other... Si senor. It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good. I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this. Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget. Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha! You're so lucky! Good one... [clapping] Well... Pow pow pow... [hands making gunshot impression, sporadic clapping] [Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down] I know where this is goin'. No... No. Spite her - ok [laughter] Oh, stop it Dwight. No no no no no no! Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way. That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot. Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right? Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind. We are, we are a family. Oh very funny. Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy? I don't believe I have had the pleasure. Jefferson. Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum] [at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw... caw... caw caw... caw... You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not. I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people. Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... [Stanley is laughing] Oscar, you're gay. Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. [Stanley is still laughing] Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe. [clapping and murmurs of appreciation] They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case. [breathing heavy over intercom, starts laughing] [over PA] This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. [snickering] I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. [wheezing laughing, starts coughing] Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it. Could I stick it with a pin? [still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine. You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert. What? You find it? All right. Would you like fries with that? Please drive around. [knocks on Pam's hotel door] Hello, good morning. You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles. Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. [laughs] No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy. No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie. Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night. Well that goes without saying. Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant?  That's... ...kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something. No. Oh, all right. No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare. Then listen to your iPod, Pam. Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk. You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so... Is that why your wearing makeup today? Hello, Rolando, how are you? Rolando, [clears throat] I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime. Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked. That's what I do, steal my trick. [notices Karen's pregnant] Oh my God. Is that Jim's? Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and... Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months? [on cell phone] NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump? I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died. Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? [Pam tosses a handful of Mounds bars at everyone] I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. [starts singing] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it. I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. 'M' your name is Mark. Got it. It works. But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say? Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try. Oh, I still have more. She is pregnant. She is knocked up. 'K' Karen. Pam, let's go. I grab this [grabs a chain saw], and I turn it on and I say, 'Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre.' No, don't worry, the chain is off. Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it. It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or? Oh, great. No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time. Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment. I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean. Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think. Why? No.  I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.? Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small. She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that. [scoofs] I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester. [chuckles] Okay. I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success. I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy. [holding a chainsaw] And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.' You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. Do I look okay? Hi. Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch. Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here? Oh- She's not here? A.J. She has a boyfriend. How could she do this to me, Pam? I can't do the presentation, I can't- [voice cracks] ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face] I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? [exhales] And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die. [laughs] [sighs] I can do this. Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper' and get them to 'Show us the money!' Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. [some raise their hands] Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name? A.J. What kind of name is A.J.? What do you race cars? Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date? Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious? Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking] It's all connected. Shut up. [to A.J.] Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?' [sighs loudly] Does it feel good? [grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay. Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards. No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. [sighs heavily] Okay... okay. [sighs, touches Holly's sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly's computer named 'Dear Michael,' plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer] Want some pie? I went through Holly's things. I stole a sleeve of her sweater. I also stole something off of her computer. A document called 'Dear Michael.' I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it. No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it. Yes. How? I know, I know. You're right, you're right. No, that wouldn't- No, you don't have to do that. Okay. [leaves to get laptop] Well? She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say? You're sure? [smiles, sighs, chuckles] Okay. I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something. Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him! Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony! Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty. [coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you? ...Jim. Ayyyy! Ayyyy! [laughing] What was that? That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy! Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud? Yeah, I hear ya.   It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you're hurting... Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans] Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces. Pam, really, they're back? Can I have a word with you, Jim? Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office. Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment. Mm-hmm. Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest-- --that none of us can be a part of-- [gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party. So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only. So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other. I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that -- Okay.  Hello. Oh, OK. Yeah, me too. Oh, well, that's fine. Yeah, can I point something out to you? You're actually talking a lot. Okay, here we go. Oh, God. [Michael clears his throat] Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch. Type O-Ocean Spray. Yick. I looked at the bag. I looked straight at the bag. Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them? That was mean. A hat. That is full of soup. What? Oh, already. Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out] [ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank] Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go? OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove. Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us. [in a Mexican accent] Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah? Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar. Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest. If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else? Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story. Really sad. Oh my God. Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him! Alright who's next?  Where's Andy? What? You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this. No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together. No.  Not a giant net. I was thinking maybe like a mixer. Old fashioned meet market -- -- I don't think it is. These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done. Hey. Ah, still early. [sighs] So how you holding up? No.  No, I meant about being single today. Meh, exactly.  Eh. Oh, here we go. Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead] Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig. Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self. [after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from? Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better. So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair. Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk. It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late. No reason. Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by. It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her. Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched. Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away. Hey, you don't deserve her. Hey, if anybody wants to go... Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake]  Oh, thanks. You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit. [after some encouragement] OK. Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good. Pam? Pam? Knock, knock. I know you are. Knock, knock. [at same time as Pam] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1 They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over] Buddha. [puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh] I, I need something to wipe my hand. That was helping. It was classic. No... God. Alright. Who's there? KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face] What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight] What are you doing? You, you like that? Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it. [to Jim] Who's there? Dwight, get the door. Answer the door. I'm not gonna answer it Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa. Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please! No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans! The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy. I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm. Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.' No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon. No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right? Woo hoo. Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips... ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession? Invite them on the tour. Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account? Yeah? Yeah. I thought I did. So... Well no harm no foul. You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good. Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot. Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen? Irrelevant. OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet? My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs] Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right? No, they can't. Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about. Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so - Thank you, Jim is with me. Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist. OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes. OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone] That is not constructive. [on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so-- How are you doing? [reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera. Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know. I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant. You're breaking up. OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant. Yes. No. [long pause] Yes. [Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea. Woah, wow, who told you that? [same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight. I'm not taking... I'm not taking... Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary. Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets. Why do you have a diary? OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up. Yes, you did. What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary] Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us? We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking-- Umm, nacho chips. Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me. Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly. [sighs] It's not ready yet. I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house. May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight. Yes they are, you just don't care about the information. He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired. I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... Right. That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom. That's why you made the decision. That's why you made... You kind of have. Yes. [seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation. Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it? Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea? Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight? Give me the details of how that happened. What? David? David? David? Could I be a part of the meeting also? There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea. OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that? Oh how dare you. You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard? Oh please. Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge... ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas. They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom. Thank You! Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame. When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours. I want to see it. I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary] Give me...  Give me the diary. I like it. I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here. And classy, yeah. [watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership. Yes. He is. That's what makes him classy. Strawberries? Not classy at all. French. Classy. [on speakerphone] Yes? Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello? Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is. Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish. Yes. What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous. You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish. Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on! Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles. Took me all night. I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental. All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department. Oh, nerd alert! This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that. This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange [points to Andy] There you go! Where's the other? Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history. Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps] Oh! Well... Above and beyond. That's true. No. Absolutely not. Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people. Well, why don't- Charles is going to tell you. Well, it's not official. Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance. Well- Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work. Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet. I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled. [on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed. It was my understanding. Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability. But the branch is still mine? Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party? Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence] I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before. Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here? Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names. You're not from paper? Does David know this? Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point- And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear? Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back. Whatever David wants. [on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks. No! You idiot! [hangs up] Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.  [redials] Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine. And I really really need to talk to David. I was never given a name. [hangs up, he and Dwight sigh in relief] Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast? I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad. Nobody thanked me. For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical. [on phone] Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone! Yep. Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may. Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved. Yes it is! No, it is not. Ok, so we're on the same page, great. Ok, Michael, what are you doing? No, seriously. How old are you? Five years old? I'm gonna walk away. I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room. What is that smaller stripper holding? Ok. Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles. Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead. It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay. But it's cool, and it's- Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . . Yeah, why don't you do that? Yeah, here we go. Ok. What? Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story! Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves] Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? [looks into empty office] [points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day? I drove. Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned. Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this? Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again. Clearly that's what you wanted. Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot. I've put having a family on hold. And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington. I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that. Ok. [gets up to shake David's hand] I quit. You have no idea how high I can fly. I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Should've peed before I left. Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door. No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building! I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.' Why would I do that? You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it. Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar's ear] Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on. [slightly drunk] What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And I'm going to stop worrying about calories. I have a job. Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted. Any good headhunter knows I am available. You're 'I need you to' is my command. Hey. You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis! Oh! Hey. What is this about? Oh. Me too, me too. Is this wine? I already have wine. Hmm? For? Yes I am. Where you from? That's a drive! [sighs] Thank you. [groaning ceases] You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. [dials phone] [sighs] What am I gong to do?  Uh... [chuckles]. PSST! PSST! Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company. yeah! Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper. Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline. Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes. Close them. Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this? Obviously. Oh, agreed, mmm, except... Hey hey... what's up Chuck? No I'm staying. Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying 'Dunder Mifflin' at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else? You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk. This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now. Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I'm on it, don't worry.  So, how do I do that? Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape? Thank you very much. I'm starting my own paper company. Yeah. Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in. Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so Potential, lots of potential. yes. It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um... That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing. So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now. I made it sterile. I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me. No, no no. Okay. Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don't have to convince me. [from inside the restroom] Stanley? Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now. Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company. Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars. You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said 'Yes' to that either. Hmm? Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks... Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building. [to everyone] Well here we are... I would just like to... [yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I'm outta here! ... and I feel free! Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please! Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone. I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere. No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer? So which way are you leaning? Thanks Jim. Okay, Okay, we don't have much time.  Just act normal.  Don't look at me people. Stop.  Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me.  Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  You're older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?  [Pam is thinking hard] Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot.  Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me.  Come on Phyllis.  Here we go, here we go! Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on! I think maybe Hank should be here. You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it. You are? Okay.  It's going to be great. Right... Executive assistant. Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well... Jim? Well, okay, lets go. Are people watching? Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here. Bye. Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi. Yes I was. Yes I was. That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in. Thank you. Would you like some french toast? What shape? Alright. After breakfast. So how you feeling about the new company? You excited? About the new company? After breakfast. No, I'm whipping them. Just let go. Let go, please. Just gimmee - I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs. [doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse. I'm not overwhelmed, Pam. Don't patronize me, Pam. I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients. It's totally impossible! Assemble a sales team. A dream team. Okay, Ryan. He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package. Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met. He worked at that telemarketing place. Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor. Yeah. Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her. Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm... Alright. Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.' How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office? Okay. Okay. 'Achey Breaky Fart.' No! No No. No. 'My Stumps.' Like 'My Humps' but a guy with no legs. We can do this. Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay. Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael. Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files. Well, it has always been a lifelong dream. I'm... Excuse me. Yes? Yes, it is. Yes. It is. Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here? Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company? Uh, nine. [Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing. He's stealing them. Okay, okay. He's already paying for himself. Right here. Oh yeah. Sounds awesome. People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want. Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper. Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit. By wanting it more. By working hard- Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee. And I offer same day, free delivery. Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this. Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other... Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that. What's that? Blech. Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many. Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay... I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit. So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods] You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating. I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine. [walks into room] Okay. It's right in the middle of the paper belt. Yeah, I'm good. You good? You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap'] Yes, I am, Charles. Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared. It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.  [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser] Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car] I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company! We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea. We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon. I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it. I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.] Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend. Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before? Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals. Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it! Would someone just make the copy? Just make that copy okay? They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim. I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B. They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get? Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small. Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own. Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do? No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.' That's my corner. No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work. Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.] Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour. Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere. What for? Yes. Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em. Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake? Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company. Hey Pam. You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been? Yeah? Well, at least you're still being honest with me. These are shaped like paper. I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone. Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers] They don't know that! Give him a guarantee. Just say the word. Yes! You did! Oh yeah! She did it! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office] Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important. Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth] Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth] Hey. [gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good? Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh? I really appreciate it. It's for your trouble. No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this. Yes, I do. That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go? Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women. That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan? Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce. Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat] [on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin. Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well? I'm not following you. Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift. Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing? Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!'] [Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us? Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now? So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you? Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot? Dwight? Is the cool new guy Charles? Is it Stanley? Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright? Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup! Dwight, run! You be cool. Just-what's going on? Mm-do... Dwight would not- I. Understand. Nothing. [Michael storms into office] Wow. It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him. It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon. I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you? Hello, traitor. I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you. I'm just getting hardcore with him. Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby. [on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there? [on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV? Wow. High score? Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want? So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy? No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no- Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet. Toward the sun. Noon. You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running] Dwight. I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles. So you just rat me out? You could have said no. If you want a truce, I will give you a truce. I do too. Cooper's. Damn it. [Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at? Really? That's weird. We didn't see any. What? Yeah, sure. Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec. [Michael answers phone] Yeah. Dwight, not now, we've been robbed. No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying 'Dwight did it!!'] You? What about our truce? On purpose? Why? Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it. Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard! Dwight, do you mind if we talk? If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed. Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client. Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now. You can hear me, but I can't hear you. Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much. Walking in the door... Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office] [on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn. Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates. What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow? That's very rude. I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin... Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month. That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual. Good, good, good. I will see you. I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.' I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess. He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads. Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners. He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket. Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate. Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt. It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route. [honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied! Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam. Milk and sugar. That's what I said. Every morning. We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those. You know what we need?  We need some couches in here. Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft. Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top. Most do in the magazines. We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft. How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy? They are correct, sir. Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss. Lowest in town. Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is. Explain that. Well, we don't-- Whatever, yeah. Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business. Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again. Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please. Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check. Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died? I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this. I would love that. Was it nice? I love Pad Thai. No.  There's a lot I haven't done. [knocking on door] Hmm? We're not hiring, Jim. Listen, I can't make you laugh right now. Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl-- No-- We don't have-- [stammers] Uh... Yes. Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks. That's a pun. Yep. Oh... wow. Of course not. Nope, nope, nope. Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke. Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it. Ah... I'm good, I'm good. It is.  I'm good. Hello. Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables... And we are prepared to reject that offer. Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer? Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was. I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you. [stutters] We'll have to talk-- Just amongst ourselves. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We are so rich. No. It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish? Agreed? Shut up, shut up.  Hello? I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring. And I want Charles gone. I need him gone. Okay, then I want Pam back. Sales. Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday. And Ryan. You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me. And dental this time. These are our demands. Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names. That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court. Can we have the room please? Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about! There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it. No, no. You're done. Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it? [whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes. Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting. If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now. Yes. Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different. When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that. Oscar, what were you going to say? All right. Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen. It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and-- No, you lost those clients. Okay. Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can. [hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend. Pamela. Yep. I know. I do?  Well--Where is that bowl? Michael Scott Paper Company only. Okay, well--- I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom. Against who? The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with. Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.",ENFP,Ne,Fi
Oscar,"You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing. Can't you just tell us. Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here? It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor. There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house. Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back. All right. It was fine. Martinez. What part Native American? Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense. OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico. And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States. My parents were Mexican. Thank... Yeah... Mexican isn't offensive. Like what? What connotations, Michael? You meant something. I'm just curious. He literally won't come out of his office. Michael, can I talk to you? It's like a pay decrease. This is not good. What was that? I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is. I don't know. Well? OK, the health care plan. Well, you have no right to ask those questions. Because I don't want my benefits slashed. I'm reporting you. Michael I need to talk to you. [opens door] Michael. Michael, Michael I... [blinds rustle] ... inside. Oh, yeah. Here's the rest of them. Uh, I'm sorry to bother you. My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if... Donate to the charity? Thank you. That's... that's... that's very generous. Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is. It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.' I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity. Yeah. Last year, he walked 18 miles. How old is she? Uh, nice party Michael. Per mile. Thank you, Michael. My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic. I never suggested... Michael, if I gave you... Thank you. Okay. How old is she? I can help out, if you need me. What time do we have to come in? I'm on the phone. [in video] That's supposed to be confidential. The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like. I think many people find that character slightly racist. Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits. I saw it. Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know. Eh. It's a scoreboard. Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out. Yeah. Sweet! You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball. Pair of shoes! Ah... Great. I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that. Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week. And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on. [in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... . [in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright. [in phone] No, no. Finish the... Pam. Michael. What are you implying? Yes? Yeah? This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh. Oh... hey. Oh. [fixes his dress] Signed what? Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl. She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out. Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner. Ok, that's a joke. Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet? Yeah, now it doesn't make any sense. No, they just made out.  That's it. Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me. Michael, I don't know what to say. Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit. Yes. Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers? Actually, it's just- Ok... Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance. I'm on a call. Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they--- I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain. [rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat. Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of .. Why are we doing this? I'll take the ... teapot. You got a bonus check? I'm in. Michael? Poor Richard's? Towards me. Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good. Creed. Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too. I'll take the tea pot. No, I just like tea. Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower. I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool. What did you end up with? You like music at least? You're kidding. What was your DJ name? Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy. Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went. Where do you guys think we're going? Right. I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat. ...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good. What's up, Pam? Ok... [Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it. Hello. Hello? Yeah I think I came down with the flu. Yeah, I feel terrible about it. I have the chills. I feel nauseous and my heads killing. Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed. I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish] Are you going to tell Michael? Hey, Michael. Hey, Dwight. What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong. It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael. Are you kidding?  I thought it was you. The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO. My mom. [puts card in pocket] Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith. Here you go, Creed. That's great, man. I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care. What the hell is going on here? I've got a time share in Key West that might be available. Is that Chet Montgomery? Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something. I was in the middle of something. Stanley. Who is this guy again? This sounds like a get rich quick scheme. Skin cancer is treatable. It's going to be okay. ...I'll do it. It wasn't me. What is this? No, I have not. What are you implying? Okay. I'm done with this. So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it. Is that true, Toby? You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc. How? No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or... It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed... Angela! Since Christmas. No. What's the next one? I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the... No. How 'bout, she takes it down? Fine. Again? We do that every year. It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering. Let it ride. Let it all ride. No, that's a flush. What's going on, Michael? No, it's fine. That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that. No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay. Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan. Am I the first gay man you ever knew? What are you doing?! Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now? No one else in this office is gay. You sound pretty defensive Michael. I think the problem with this office is that I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life. I would rather not. No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small! Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug] I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay. [Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?! Yes, I'm gay. Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out] Hey, everyone. Oh, that's very funny. [sits at his desk] Hi, Angela. The one of all women? Because I'm gay? OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you. I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party. Michael -- Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe. Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great. It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. You're the one who said we needed more culture. It's her first try. Meaning what? Well, those aren't Pam's strong points. You know I don't like to participate in the... Really, it's just that I don't like to participate... It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy. Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong. [laughs] That's disgusting. These wings are all fat and bone. Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up. It was crazy. Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero. It was insane! What are you guys talkin' about? Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant. Forty-two. That's really not our job. I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls. [on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale. [laughs] Yes. [air high five] I expect you to apologize for that, Angela. Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five] We do a lot more than that. I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls. Would you, please? Please. I don't wear a Speedo, Michael. What? Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh... Turkey is a healthy meat. If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see. Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs] Maybe you should talk to her? Before... Michael... I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense. You're not sure that you have the job. Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck] Oh, Michael's not going anywhere. Do you really think he's qualified for that job? [laughs] Mm.  Yeah. So ten What--- What are you winking for? Home is where the I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things. So she's really going to be fine? [whispers to Kevin] Subtle. You pushed Darryl out the window? [to Kevin] Separate cars. Like what? Dwight please! You're doing great Michael, look at you go! More or less. There's no proof of that. It's fair. I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist. Michael, do you know what secular humanism is? Oh. Creed? Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black] You did what? [pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner] You're forty-three.  Mick Jagger's like sixty-five. Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw? I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you. I think I'll just take my chances. It's never gonna happen. This is why I'm here? Why aren't you in New York? Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from? It's not pizza. Stanley, could you look up 'accomplices'? Because we're looking up jail time. Thank God. I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory. Don't. You know the octagon sign means stop. An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you? Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly. He's not even good at his first one. Michael, are you having money problems? You heard me correctly. Not at all. Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen. Still, that's not anything. This is a lot of credit card debt. Mmm. Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon. Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme? Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house. The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that. This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment. Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy. She has to know. Michael, this is a presentation tool. I'm done! Jan is smart. So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt. Jan. Michael left. I don't know. I don't think so. Jan, he went running that way. Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money. I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from? You have CDs? Okay, good, okay.  What bank? [whispers] Case Logic. I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit. Hi. When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain. To be Edwardian.  His best work. Sure thing Pam, can't wait. Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me. Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside? What are you doing? Yes. Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background] And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!? Okay, did you get it out of your system. How does it end? Okay, that's enough, uh.  Thanks, Andy. Wow.  Now we can afford hard-cover books. Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs] Ok. [picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool. No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. Why don't you just have an apple? Probably went to his head. Hey, Jim. So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note] I totally see that. [looking at spreadsheet] Yeah, yeah. It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim... Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away. Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin] I am livid, Absolutely livid. Elliot! We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas. Why? Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish? [to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK? They Honestly, the book is so much better than this. Michael that doesn't seem... safe. Why are you telling us this? Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.] We'll see. Dunder Mifflin paper. Hey. Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face? Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard. Totally, they're the best. Why don't we make corn burgers? Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers. All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke. OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on. Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City. Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch. I'm gay! What's the joke? Oh, you think it's a choice? I'm messing with you, Holly. OK. Yes, she is. And clinically insane. OK. [Kelly faints] Oh! So how was your date? Oh my God, what happened? Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character. I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!' How was Friday night? He'll call. [seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy] I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs. Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive. It's just... Have you been to the beach yet? Okay, Toby, I gotta go. I thought you were already engaged. That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules. Exactly, Andy. Pass. Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch. That's a big ethical area? Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar. Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby? She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller. Me too. Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen? Great, they stole my laptop. How does that even compare? I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back. So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this? 100 dollars. [Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome. We'll miss you. [chuckling] Isn't it a seven-hour drive? I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because.... Okay. Bye. Here. I'm good. [whispers] Andy brought one too. I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich] I'll check us in. I'm probably going to leave after one drink. Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie's hand] Yes. Michael, why? How do you even know they're gay? Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table] What are you doing? If you don't mind me asking--- Okay. Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time. How could anyone stand that woman? What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela? I want to know. You haven't had sex? Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or? Andy, something is wrong with that woman. I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her. Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her! Why won't you do Andy? Hey. Yeah, it was. Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up. I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh] I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night. You--- you call--- you called her. Alright. Okay. Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting? Mmm... What is first base with Angela? I had a good time too. Thank you. No. [reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.' No kidding. The note.  So 'holier than thou'. Here are our final actual costs for this year. As you can see, we did pretty well, so... Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis... Right there. You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300. But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget. Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars. So you have an extra dollar. So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer... And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand. We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget. We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need. No, no, please. Please do not do this. Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine? Pam, you make more copies than anyone. So Michael, what do you think? Michael? I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with? [laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael. The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing] That's the original. Do you know? I think you know. Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is? Why'd you say dollars? What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus. You're gonna get us a copier then? Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done. You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing. Hey, we're going with the chairs. I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all. We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then? What about February 2nd? Now? It's our Christmas party. Do you know how to do an intervention? Where did you get this? Thirty-one is humanly impossible. That's impossible. What is wrong with you? She is engaged. Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight? That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form. There you go. You said that yesterday. This is nuts. Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show. The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win. Kevin, c'mon. See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot. That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing] Ah! My hand!  That's hot! Stay alive!  I'm getting help! You're too heavy! Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you? That's offensive. I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry. [yelling at Michael in Spanish] Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday. That reeks, and I'm trying to eat. Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement] Wow. [quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away] [Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two? Angela, you're more chipper than usual. Where'd you get that kind of money? You have your cats on Nanny-Cam? It could be snacks, or- Wha- Good God! [laughs] [chuckles] Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows] I have no idea. I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball. TV. I don't think so. I can't. Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself? I was stupid, I told him. He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans] I'm not done yet. Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here. Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you? He's on one of his honeymoons. He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage. Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office? It's possible. We can stay a little longer. Come on, we'll all go. Ten percent? They're our largest client. It's gonna hurt. They can. Yes, they can. Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is? These aren't announcements. Do you have specifics? Well, it's- Dunder Mifflin. At least he is in the building. I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so... That's a lot. [bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it] You put a note in my food? Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so. Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials? You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael? Five years? It's just not prudent Michael. I can't believe this is really happening. And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building] Phyllis, Phyllis. Use it in a sentence. Try another sentence. I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important. Why don't you just ask him-- What have you been doing? Nothing.  I didn't say anything. I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change. No. I don't think so.",INTJ,Ni,Te
Pam,"Well. I don't know. What? Uh, yeah. Just a fax. You haven't told me. Uh, yeah, the one... You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet. I have an important question for you. Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? This is Mr. Scott. I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. You just still have these messages from yesterday. What? Don't we all? Nothing. I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe. Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs] [Laughing] Yeah. So when are we going out? OK. Yeah. Hey. Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring. Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. You got a fax. What? Why? Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? Are you serious? I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me. You're a jerk. Hey. Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with... It's better, thanks. Yeah. Is...? Um... Are you... Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend. I guess. What? Wired. Oh, yeah. Smoked turkey. Yeah, Freecell. I know. I saw that. I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch. Um, hi. How are you? Great. Thank you. That's nice, Dwight. OK, I like your food. OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver. [stirs] Mmmm. Oh. Sorry. Um, that spells incest. It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either. Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um... Seventy-six percent. What's yours? You're doing fine. People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are. No. No. No. No. No. It didn't have anything to do with race. One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time. What card was she? I'm not making any copies. Nothing new. There's nothing new. Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera] No. I have a life. You should try it sometime. [laughs]... your problem. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Where are you? Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the... No you're not. OK. Still no one calling. Dwight, what... OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan? This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything. Why would you want to raise your cholesterol? Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it. Michael, he made huge cuts. Where are you going? I'm inventing new diseases. So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that? Nice. It's an epidemic. [on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam. Good, how are you? Busy? Um, I'm not bothering you, am I? You don't have anything you're doing? Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything. I might go to the mall. I need new shoes. Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job. We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Yeah. You promise these are confidential? Did you just mark on that? You made a 'P.' In case I get sick. Because we're not married. We haven't set a date. [Dwight laughs] Shut up, Dwight. I'm not talking to you anymore. Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up. Oh. Okay, umm... that would be Meredith. But it's not until next month. You still want to have a party? How about green? This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her. It is... her birthday. An alliance? What does that even mean? [whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second? Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues? Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything. OK, yeah. He's in a box? [on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that... Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card] Oh, tell me, tell me. [laughing] That's perfect! Hey, Hey! Come on. It's just office pranks. [telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please. I wasn't really going for anything. Are you being serious? Okay. No one's calling. Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls. Okay. Okay. Yes. No. Yeah, I could tell. That was a good example. Okay. [telephone rings] [smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you. [whispering] I'm so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] ... seriously, we're just... My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding. [on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years. Please don't throw garbage at me. I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance. Maybe Angela would cheerlead. Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones. Yeah, you're gonna need it. [laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive. And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so... Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake. Woo! Mmm-hmm. Hey. Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub. New pants? Abercrombie & Fitch? Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race. Uh, Michael? Hey, there's a... There's a person here... There's... There's a person here who wants to sell handbags. Okay, I told her you'd talk to her. Okay. There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30. No. That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin. It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with. We're not dating, we're engaged. [smiles] [mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that. Oh! Oh... Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad. [smiles in agreement] You're horrible. Yeah, what's that? I'm engaged. So... I wished, right? Yeah, I gave it to you. So, can I..? [points to the door] [nods] That's what he said. [not looking at Roy] Hi. Roy... Cut it out. Stop it. [laughing] [giggling] Cut it out. Stop. [giggling] [breathless] Stop, I can't breathe. Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me.  We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone. I'm bored. No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend? Really? What are you guys going to do? That's great. That's cool. I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move. Cause Roy's got a truck. Uh, huh. Yes. Great. Okay, I'm gonna head back. You know Michael's been talking to her too. What do you think his chances are? [laughs] I like that song. [laughs] 10 years ago. Ugh... You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you. Michael has taped Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great. [quietly laughing] It wasn't. I swear. We're not laughing at you, Dwight. Um, just something somebody wrote. Um, it's kind of private. Okay, now I'm laughing at you. You're taking away our bathroom? Michael... ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom. Um... Sorry. ...because that's what happens every time! No. [Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to. If you would have asked me that, then you would know. Oh no, I just, I decided to stay. I'll just get a ride home from Angela. Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping. [to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink? No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs] Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom. Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet! More Dundies! Fine work! Fine work Stanley! Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in] I have so many people to thank for this award. Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too. Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie. And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!! Nothing. What? Dwight, get off me! Oh my God! I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!! I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall. Hey, um, can I ask you a question? Um, I just wanted to say thanks. Bye. I am fine. Okay. [laughing] I am fine. Oh, my God. Dwight, let me up. I'm fine. You're holding up three fingers. You are? My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in. I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody. mmhmm. Oh really? Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today. Thanks, Kevin. Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke. She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her. Thank you. Uh... my mother's coming. I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks. [ecstatic] Oh my god! Hello! I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever. Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area. This is where I used to keep my computer. But then I moved it. Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So... So this is like, um, an organization station... Hey! Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time. Mom! No. Ten minutes. Then we can go to dinner. He said what? Good morning, Michael. Nothing. You look nice today. You look real thin. You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good. Thin handsome, Michael. We're not dating. We're not dating, I'm engaged. I would say no. I would drown myself. Hey. I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon. Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick. Yeah. I realize that might be harassment. Okay. [laughs] Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him. You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it. Here. Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight. Oh. You headed out? Ok. Have a great time. Yeah, I changed them to your new address. Yup. Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription. [shakes head] Yeah. Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system. Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton. In English, box of paper snowshoe racing. The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens. Go!  Go!  Go! It's Phyllis! Flonkerton. Are you sure you don't want to play? Come on Angela, don't you have a game? Well, let's play, what is it? We're friends. I made something for our closing ceremonies. Automatic voicemail. [sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet] I have 59 voicemails. Sure. Really? Cool. Hey. Morning. Okay. What? What is this? Oh, my God. What are we gonna do? I know. I know what to do. Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it. Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot. Dwight, I swear, we didn't do anything. Okay. How about skeet Schruteing? Mmm-hmmm. Thank you. Oh, oh. Oh! Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second. Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud? [to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension. ...Would You Rather? Legends of the Fall? Well, I kind of liked Legal... I take it back. I take it back! Okay. Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused... Yes. In my top three, so suck it. Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and... No, my all time favorite! All time favorite. You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'. You should tell him. Dwight. Kay. Hey! Um... Oscar's kind of cute. Ooh, Toby! I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car. That's here. I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside. Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done. [chuckling] You're not stuck. Really? Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called. [entering] You wanted me? [notices Michael's costume] Papier-mache? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Why did you put it off until Halloween? I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little. So it's a man? I just answer the phone. You're costume is fantastic! [laughs] Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay... Okay, greatest strength. A dog-like obedience to authority But that doesn't sound good. He's a gun nut. No, I made brownies. ... What? I made brownies. I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts. [on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott. Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real. Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job. Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge. Jim... What happened? Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was... Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out. I don't really have any control over that Stanley. Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm. Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign. It's just last year you... Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier. Well, is that really a priority? [Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks. I am just following the website. Yes, you have very nice teeth. Could you practice on the forms? I don't know. French Onion? Ok. I just have a quick question. No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car? He's a purple belt. That's really high. It's just out there, you... Yeah. What? Well, look closer. Once point for me. Oh, you're dead. Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey... Yeah, you too. The shipping place closes in a half hour. This is what you had Ryan do. Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today? Wait, are those Michael's Levis? Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays. [to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk] What is going on? Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me. No, they had to come back for me. Umm... it was not that long ago. Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. [to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em? Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him- When- Ok.  There's a transcript between a naval ship- Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse. It is a screenplay.  Starring himself. Of the FBI. What is that? Hey, uh, I have to work late. Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops. Yeah. For the bugs. Yes... nice!  I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner. What are you going to do with your time off? [points to Jim's iPod] You have new music? What!? Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan's cell. Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, really? Why might some say that? Uh hmm. We didn't dance. Swaying isn't dancing. I have some faxes to get out. Hmm... Hi. I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk. Yeah, do you mind leaving? It's very important. Thank you. Oh! So close to retirement. I sincerely doubt it. It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect. Thank you. Oh, no. Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon. She missed you. I have one idea of what it means. Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this. Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you. Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward. Michael and Jan definitely made out. Maybe more. Oh, yea! Michael? Jan's on the phone for you. Sorry. What suggestion box? Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started. Sure. Hey, Jim. Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night? Can you believe who Trump fired? You didn't see it? Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting. You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here. Everyone's waiting in the conference room. Do you think Michael and Jan actually... How do you come back from that? No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that? As a human being. [Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you. He sees it. Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday... I almost lost it. That was too good. You mean yesterday's paper. Thank you. [whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately. I know! Do you think that they're like- No, right, no, no. Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe? It's like squishing a spider under a book.  It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead.  Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ? Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with. One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose? Ummmm... Hey, Angela- How's it going? Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight? No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so. Oh. Yeah. The professors would go to the parties? [to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you! Really? That's great. Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere. Oh, no, he can't make it. No thanks. Hey. Definitely. Jim's bedroom. Cool... This is your desk. Your home office? Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect. Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here. And Dwight would be like- Umm, [gasps] yearbook! [finds Jim's picture] Ooooohhh no! You were so dorky! Hey Phyllis, come here for a second. Have you heard anything about any secret office romances? That's ok.  It's ok. Oh, yeah I gave that up. Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws. Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on. Hey, Michael, accounting needs your approval on- Hi! Good. Thank you. We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house. Uhh... I might be late. Ok. [to the cameraman] Did I miss anything? You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party. I think the tree looks nice. [opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome. Yeah, we call it White Elephant. I'll take the iPod. I want the iPod. Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But .. Sorry, I .. Maybe because you hated her present so much. How much? I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out. So what are you going to get me instead? [laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot] I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .. [opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture! Yeah, I think I made the right choice. Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer? Do you want me to help you with that? Yes. Are you kidding? Just let us open up the presents, Dwight. It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings. Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup. Um, I don't think so, I just bought it. I love these. Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo. A ski mask and a swimsuit. And brush our teeth. How about the anchor? I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October. No, I'm not going to do that. Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out? It's getting kind of rowdy down there. Sometimes I just don't get Roy. I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader? I'm cold. Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice. No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there. No, thank you. How about the anchor? You've been to the lake before? Yes, you should have. Love you. Yeah. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Michael, what's wrong? Ok, wait wait wait wait... Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?! Ok... Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt. [exasperated] Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone. Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him. Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend? What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window] Ohhhhhh! Oh my gosh. Is he ok? You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate. No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot. You didn't have any. And do my job? It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment. Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy. You've seen one of these? Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it. Really? Oh! Ha, haha. Pan? Oh, God. [phone rings] What. Tell me before I come there. No. No. Really? What?! That is so cool.  Thanks Dwight! Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend! No, he's actually been really nice and helpful. Wow... Dwight, you have your hand up. Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight. Get up, get up. Yeah. I know. I know. I just want to say goodbye ok? Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different. It's just hard to explain. Oh my goodness! Come here. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok? I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan. Really? Michael went in with him? Wow. Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go. Ok. Bye. Hey, Oscar? I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow. I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that. Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God. I bought my veil. Ummm... Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and... That's a communal bowl. Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know. Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle? Ok, it was the second one. Nuh-uh. What did you guys talk about? I hate you. Hey. Did you find anything good in your desk? Score. Big day. Oh. Right. No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started. No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well. So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now? Mmm, hmm. Cool. Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay? Oh, no, that's, you don't have to. No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so. Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise? Yep. No thanks. You got a package. Um, Pam plus Spam plus...? Right. It was great. Mm-hm. Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January. What? I don't know. [looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know. No, I don't think it's a bird. Open the door up! Thanks! A little. [giggles at Roy] You're gonna throw my things on the ground? [to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend. [to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding? Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know. That doesn't seem fair. What's our punishment? [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back! [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator. [voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert. [voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you. [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe. [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow. [voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk. Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times. Jan. Michael's still at the door. Mmmhmm. I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is... Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way. Thanks. Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off... Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um... Hey. How's it going down there? Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies. No. [laughs] Almost. Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great. Um... It's really cool. Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me. How did you know? Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons. Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway. What? You have something you want to say? Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices! Yeah. It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... . Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please. You did? Yeah. Okay. How about that one? I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and... [Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis. Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big. That's OK. Guess what? That's great. [Meredith scowls] OH, Holy God! You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here. You need to get something for your girlfriend. Tightly wound? Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is. No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her. That you remember her. Yeah. [delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar. [walks away] Join the club. Hey. I guess, yeah. Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her. I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me Heading out? Bye. [Jim leaves] Night Phyllis. Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.' You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev? Where is she? Cool. I'm gonna spend it with my fiance. What are you guys doing? Nice. Are you sad that Dwight beat you? Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue? Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later. Ok, cool. I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone. Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my... Do we know anyone who was in the accident? You mean Toastmasters? Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding? Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think. Of course. He's one of my closest friends. Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date. Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just... Australia? I have always wanted to go there? That's awesome. Where are you staying? When are you leaving? Oh. Oh yeah. That's too bad. It's ok. I got it. Yes, but they are both in danger. The ones that say 'love' on them? Oh. Doesn't matter. As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start. Is that okay? I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel. Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy] Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign] I reminded you last night. Don't you think you should say something? Michael, I think that as the boss you should really--- Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool. I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one. That is! He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone. So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's Mmhmm. Sure. You're welcome. It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see? Really? Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh? Yeah, I get to do this like, every week. I know. I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves] My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam] I like extra cheese, too. Yeah. Do you like to draw, Abby? Me, too. Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought. Hmm. Happy birthday Michael. I said happy birthday. One's good. Michael wants a strippergram? Michael, I have Jan on the line. I can sign for it. When does he hear? Ohh... poor Kevin. If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week. ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here? Sixty-nine cup of noodles. And his favorite lunch. You use fabric softener? No, I do. [checking watch] We should probably head back. You dare me? How old are you? [over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. [loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you... Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I hate you. No. [laughs] Who is that? I got it. Michael? This is from all of us. Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day. [laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can. He does everyone in the office. Jinx! Buy me a coke. No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out] Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx. Sorry, that's not my problem. Hey guys, what's going on? Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.'] I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs. Uh, hmmm. Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that. What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means] [placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam] Hey. Ten minutes. Kevin. Do someone else. Angela. The eyebrow. Last night? Let's see. I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that? I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy. And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp. Has she been on the phone the whole time? [reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this. [telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer. No. Yeah? Oh, thanks! Uh... There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy. Win! How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays? Win. Win Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code. Nice. [notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me? Wait, what did it say? I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?! [gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out! I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe. I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby. Don't take her side. I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff. Yeah. Angela, I want to talk to you about something. [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date. What?! Okay. [telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer. That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings? It's a nice tux. Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert. No, they stopped making that show. No, that's Afghan. Oh, nothing. They're wedding bands. Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now. There's a KISS cover band in here. I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work. I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza. Have three stages, yeah. Oh. Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums. On the drums! On the drums! Oh, my... No! No! No, come back! No, no, no! Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding. [phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you. Carol Stills. Your realtor. It's still me. Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt. Carol, you're on with Michael. Michael, Jan's on line two. It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael. [People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God! Yeah, right,' what? [Laughs] I have good cards. Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in. Straight. It's okay. I'll see you at home. Okay. Bye! Hey. Good, especially after I took all your money in poker. About when you want to give me more of your money? Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight. What? What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that? Well, I um... I... I can't. You have no idea... ...what your friendship means to me. I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault. [On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss] Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective. It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head. Me too.  ...I think we're just drunk. No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim--- [loud sigh] Chicken. Excellent, thanks. Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can't really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks. Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer. Yup. I'm... painting my new apartment tonight. Yes. Thanks. Right. What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business! Yeah? No, I didn't. What was Oprah about? That's a really big decision. Maybe you should wait before you adopt. Or not adopt. Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars. You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months. Yeah. You probably won't. No, Michael. No, Michael. Sure. This. Thank you. Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that. I'll probably just wear this. Um... Mm-hmm. Hey! What's up? [answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up? Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here. So how do you come up with your cartoons? You dream in cartoons? How fun! Huh. Freedom fries. Yeah. Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan. More freedom fries. That's great. I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know. [walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone? [with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo. Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times. [on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear] Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes. [pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok. Really?  I don't know. Not at work, I'll try it on--- ...noooo [smiling] It's too much. I'm gonna return it. Hi. Thanks. I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. What? Please go back to your desk. Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you. Yeah. I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious. Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse? But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better. [after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar? The news that you just announced?  That Ed died? Is there anything I can do? Yeah. Oh.  Okay. [extricating herself] Okay. Oh.  I would like a break. Great. I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders. You waited for me? Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die. Is it for the bird? I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box] If you wanna do something for the funeral... Maybe you could play a song on your recorder. Do you have it with you? Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into. Actually, I have it. I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay. What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten. [singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ... Hi. Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met. Closer to the epicenter, I guess. Really? Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month. Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.' I should probably head back in. But, umm, thanks for the break. Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.' Hi. Oh, I don't know if I'm... It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five. Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is. Michael. Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks. Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel. You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today. Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan. Night. 20 past 5. PM. These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli? This is a huge sale. Night, Michael. [phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Oh my God. Hi. Oh. I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day. Yeah, totally. So... Do you... Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here. A little different. What time is it there? Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know. It felt far. What? I type 90. It's true. 70? How many do you type? Come on. Tell me. You have to tell me now. No, it's, that's respectable. So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself... Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home... And, I'm freaking out. That movie is so scary! But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up. Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box. Would I make that up? Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet. I have one kitchen. It's actually... Three kitchens? [Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok? Um. Ok, bye. No, I was um... You have to go? No, I should probably go too. I mean, yeah. Bye Jim. It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier. Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal. Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you. Yeah. Really you do. I love the material. I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired. Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I just feel kind of tired, you know. Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with. Very official. I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean? Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael. Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second? It's hot in there. How's the naan? I am. You should come dance with us. No one. Here. [hands drink] Yeah. Uh... no. Well, you were never really engaged. Yeah. I kind of thought something would happen tonight too. What are you doing? I'm rejecting your... ...kiss. If you sit in the back. You say one more word; I'm stopping the car. [on phone] Michael, you're on with Jan. Michael? Your shirt is buttoned wrong. Are you okay? What did Jan want? What can't you tell me? What?! You just said that we're gonna be gone...? Michael, what's going on? It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now. Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight. He's not here. I don't know where he is. Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something? Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton? Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton? I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood. That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh. Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right? No thanks, guys. Have fun though. Really? Where did you hear that? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay. Hey! How'd the run go? That's great! Because he accomplished something. Really, Dwight? How fast are you? Really? Oh, I'll just time him later. Yeah. Are you ready? Set Go! Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby. I should probably get back to work. Good morning! Okay. Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back. Hi! I'm Pam. Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me. Oh my god! It's really you! I know. I don't care. It's really good to see you. You won't be disappointed. Hey. What happened to grape soda? Oh. You've changed so much. So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work? Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever. Yeah. I know, me too. The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good. Hey! Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do. What's up? What do you mean? Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want. We're friends. We'll always be friends. It's good to have you back. This is weird with you facing the other way. That's Stanley Hudson. He's one of our salesmen. Oh very. Hmm, that is... Janet Fenstermaker. [Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name. Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war. For both sides. Whoever paid more. Yeah. Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable! ...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink. ...Oh. That's... fun for him. [whispering] Who is it? Why would anyone go to jail for that? Okay. Angela? My dad. What was prison like? Yeah, some days I never go outside. They have art classes? Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin. Wow... I-- Wow. That was... wow. Michael, it's freezing out. Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison? Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you. Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here? Dwight, what uh... Well, get it out of here. I would like it off my desk. Can I help you, Michael? It's behind you. Michael? [hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate. Yup. Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you. For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim] They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell. So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it. Oh. Oh yeah. No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.] Michael, what's going on? I know. OK, well, why are you laying like that? Like what? Well.. um I, I don't... I don't need to know. No, thank you. I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her. Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy. Um, usually like that. I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh] Um, I really liked your karaoke idea. That could really be fun. You guys do a raffle? There is now. We just started it. What's ours again? Oh right. Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.] You can't do that. That's a great idea. You can have your snack in here. If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong. Oh, I just get those at any party supply place. Oh yeah, your mom would love that. Bye. Oh, yeah... Maybe. Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... . Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.] Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.] We have vodka! I got goose bumps. What? Can I talk to you a second? [holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas. Yeah, but we don't have a power cord. Mmm. Hmm. We'll go tell everyone. Night. We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier. It costs seventy five dollars. Ohh... [laughs] Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed. OK. It's kind of serious. How was Jamaica? That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell] Huh. It's kind of an impoverished country. But you can't today, we're doing inventory. We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed. Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor] On the left. Hey. You OK? You sure? Oh. You want to talk about it? Hmm. How far away does she live now, like ten minutes? Honestly, I think you should go easy on her. No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah. Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan! [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you. He'll call you back. OK, great. Hey. What are you doing out here? Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you. That's all she said. Sorry? Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous. Sure. What? No, it's not... it's nothing. Yeah. [Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here. Yeah. Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this. That's okay. No. No. Thank you. Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes. Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park? Okay. This one is the same price but it's got... I think that's mold. Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05. Great. Who is 'Long Tim'? I would love to meet Long Tim. Yeah. Ok. Bye Harvey. Really? Ok. Sure. Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time. That's great. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did? Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me. Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today. $100.00 Cool. Congratulations. Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest. Oh. Oh? Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand. No, thanks. I had some already. Oh, but, hey, Jim. I won an art contest today. Thanks. I sent in one of my watercolors. It was the new one I did. Yeah. Thanks. Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it? Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight. Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please. Nope. [takes the phone] Hmm. Angela? Is everything okay? Yeah. I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker] No, I will not. What? No.  No. [Leaves] Something's up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I've been eavesdropping.  It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck. Hey. Ugh. Everything okay? Well you seem a little tired. You should get more sleep. Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference. Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not. Yeah.  Don't fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God. I think that's champagne. But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them? Okay Ben Franklin! Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons? Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it. What do you mean? Oh yeah. Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together. I'm not into Jim.  Yeah. Yeah.  Sorry. Um, what? Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else. I know. Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis? Ohhh. Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever. Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time. Thanks. Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'. Also, Pam and Roy. That's my dress. What do you mean? Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks Hey. You're kidding me, right? Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding. Yeah. It's okay. Hey! Oh... I'm pacing myself. No. I'm such a dorky dancer. Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police. Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio. Thanks. I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy. You too. Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know. Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way. I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there. Dwight, what are you doing? Oh! No, you should go. ...And it's all from the same series. Called 'Impressions.' Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se. I hope so. I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you? Hey, Kenny. Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home. Maybe, I'm a little tired. Thank you. Oh, Michael. Yep. What do you mean? Um... you wanna buy it? Uh-huh. [hugs Michael] ... Thank you. Do you have something in your pocket? No thank you. [looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun. Yeah, that'd be nice. Yeah that seems fair. So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead? No, no. Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come. Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things. I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy. Oh, that duck is so cute. Hey guys. Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet? Hey. You made it. Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis. [looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite. Nice job. Oh yeah? Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you. Hey, don't you have a daughter? I want us to make it. I want a fresh start. Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us. Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim. He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed. Just listen. Don't yell! This is over. [laughs] Yes boss. ROY! Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy] I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It Oh my God, that's a woman's suit! Michael, the pants don't have any pockets. [Laughing, covering her mouth] It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little. Sorry I almost got you killed. He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right? Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now. Jim... I am really... sorry. I don't know. I'm sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices. Um... no.  No, he has a girlfriend. No, there were a lot of reasons. I know. Oh, welcome back, Andy. Oh.  Drew.  Sorry. It's called being smart. I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun. Ten... 47, 48, 49! Jim wins! I don't understand the question. Yeah... It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals. So, you're okay? Hey Creed. Hey. Yes! What are the odds that this is in any way real? Oh... God.  Oh my God, he's gonna jump. Yeah... Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it. Come down and... open it and you'll see. Dwight, what are you--- I thought I'd stay and answer the phones. Hey! [on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations? Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time. We're having a press conference? Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye. It's just the Scranton Times... You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two. Yes. Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch. Cut. Cut. One day for what? OK. Cut.  That was your best apology video ever. Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today. Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother. My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association. [door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right? What? Really? Oh, my God. [to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened? [whispering] It's just, like, so creepy. Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot. Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down. It's disgusting and demeaning. Phallus? I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things. That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones. [reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela] Yeah. Uh, Phyllis got a good look. [tires screeching] Oh. Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter. What do you want to dish about? OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan? Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with. Oh, my God. Michael, you need to get out of this. No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying] Read the pros first. What was the last one? Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy. Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other. No one said it has no calories. I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe. Don't answer it. Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on. I think I've got it. I don't think we really need that, Michael. You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming! Good luck, Michael. Don't leave a - It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand... About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned. Michael? David Wallace is on line one. Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece. Thanks Toby. I thought we were just having fun at the beach. You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities? I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day? Like what? Well... no, I don't... exactly... what? There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes] Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs? When's the contest? How am I supposed to... get... I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units. I really doubt it, Michael. I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right? I'd like to try it. But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it. Do you want us to count to three? Michael, do something! [breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh... [runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day. Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven. Jim, David Wallace is calling for you. You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really. Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim. I think they were just having fun. It tells me nothing. There's 800 of them! Hey. I think it looks great. After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you. Hey. Um, about the beach... Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird. Wow, very funny. [smiles] He's from that company in Pitts... What do you want me to do? What about Meredith? So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room. Uh, sure. I really hope you get the job. Just don't get back together with her. This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong. Right. Oh my God. [mouths to Jim] [whispers] That's crazy! [mouths] Wow! No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that [to Jim] Good luck. I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye. What happened? Thank you. Really? You will be your own assistant. Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager, Mm-hmm. Absolutely, I do. I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.' Then who do you think will get the job? [raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck? I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here. HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam] How'd it go? Did... Karen get the job? Dwight, hello. No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay. Medium rare.  Thanks. [they laugh] I know. Well, I wish you would. [phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you. I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in] Yes. [to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question? Mmm-hmm. [nods] Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh. Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me. Okay. Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends. It was for a video. A celebrity sex tape. Not relevant. Not relevant. It all happened so fast. Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again. And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in. Cool. Well have fun with that. Thank God you were there. Oh, Michael. Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers. No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far. Yeah, I haven't asked him yet. I was planning on it. Angela? [to Angela] Are you coming? Can't your other cats keep her company. Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job. OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1. I can take 3 people. Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room. Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch. I... I was thinking that we... But... Michael! Michael! [to Angela] It's gonna be OK. Michael, Angela's cat died. That's cool. Oh me too. [puts hand up for high five] Same religion. I can help you with that. [Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know. Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam. Pro-Am race for the... They hung up. What's wrong? Hmm... Ah. Angela, I'm sorry. I'm more of a dog person. Well I'm gonna start fast. Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle. Then I'm gonna end fast. Cause they're just stupid. Yeah... That was um... Yeah, I gave him a ride home because... ... We're dating. Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right? Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds? Giant check it is. Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check. And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor. I don't think so. Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks] Hey. Oh my God. You said come in! Oh my God. So I closed the door but the image of his... ... dangling participle... ... still burned in my eyes. [Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in. Yes. Or come in. On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark. They're so not. I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended. They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat. What? Look, no it was not... Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place. Darn it. I don't know I'm really committed to winning. Mmm... Yes. Yeah. [holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00. Yeah probably. Hey, Michael? I'm still having a nice day. Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00. And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much. Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping. I know you Michael, I saw you naked. Michael. Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle] Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly? Hey. I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim] Yeah. No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right? Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us? Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk] [reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally? You might want to trim it a little. Yeah, he is. Hey Toby. Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles] OK. [sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back -- Yeah. No.. [in awe] No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque. You didn't say anything to me? Can you believe that... OK. Hi. In his office. You can go right in. Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why. Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too. Oh. [man enters conference room] I think that I should help him get home. Hi. Nice to meet you. Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo. Hey. It's funny you bring that up because yes it is. I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but... I now find you repulsive. Eh... OK. Uh totally. Yeah. Thank you. OK. Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited. So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo. Thanks. That'd be great. Oh... is it... No... Um... I'm uh, I'm dating Jim. We're together. Yeah, great. OK great! Great. I got it. Hey, Michael. Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her. Sure. Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry. Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines? I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it! Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone. He does. Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness. He's going through a break-up. What kind of prank are you thinking? Yes it's too tight. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh, just one second.  We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available.  It's Jan. One of the tickets is for him. I won. Tie goes to the girlfriend. Here's a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one. Hello. Um... uh... I'll get back to you. The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here. I said it normal. Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself. I'm all over it. Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight. You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired. Yep. Nope. Ah-ha. Excuse me? Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence. [interrupting] The city mirrors, or the...? The ones for drivers to check their blind spots? Put cold tea bags on your eyes. Yeah. Mmhmm. Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow. He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character. A suit? Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information. You finished the movie. No. Go ahead. Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me. [on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you. Hello, I'm looking for a room. It says here you cater to the eldery. Trip Advsior. Two? Shoot! We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you. You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret. The Beets Motel. Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon! I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car] Oh my gosh. What are the themes? Irrigation. What? Yeah. Coward. [Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this? [Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn. Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you? It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject. How did he use it again? What's up? You're being gross. What moves? I can't believe that's not working. Um, I don't know if I really see you two together. She's very religious. Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe. That's right, you did. Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy. Michael. What's going on, why do you have a second job? Doesn't Jan have money? Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela. We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times. Table making never seemed so possible. The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm. We really did.  It was fun. Dwight. Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her] Okay. Yeah. Jim's just really passionate about Italian food. Mmm.  Mmm-mmm. [shakes head 'no'] [Mose serves bacon] Thank you, Mose. Where'd he go? Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she? Angela - she used to stay here sometimes? Okay, we're watching, Mose! I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo. No talk, I'm animating. Are you serious? Oh my God, he's really in pain. Who's that? He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that? Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too. You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar. No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim. Oh boy. Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet. No no, you can go home. I'm good. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Thank you. I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide. [on phone] Yes? Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos. Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave] How about Darryl? Oscar, did you bring it? Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware. Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive. Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny. Some people. I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica. [giggles] It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things. And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right? Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club. I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucy's torn between these two things.  She's torn between passion and convention. It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh... Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer. Very brave choice also, I thought. Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis? I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility. [nods head yes] [mouths 'I'm sorry' to Oscar] Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills. [on phone] So, there was no sales call. Wait, you're going along with this now? Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen. A little bit. Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much? Okay.  Have fun with your girlfriend! I'm kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little. Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him. Did you sleep in cabins? Who went? Do you want me to ask where you're going? Great. Oh. Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh? Do you think it's a good idea? [smiles] Hmm. Wow! That was easy. [raises hand] Conference room? Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip? Oh, no. Yes, I have been working with you forever. I don't think so. Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation. I do. No. You're welcome.  Open or closed? No. Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in] Michael has employed Dwight to track you down. Couple minutes, give or take. Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes. The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12. Hi, Kelly. I don't wanna guess. Jim. Can I see you for a second? Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl. Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you. Sorta, yes. Okay. Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you. He needs help balancing some travel receipts. Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room. [walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going? Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now? I'll make the call. [watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that? You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me! Let's go. Pick up a paddle. I am. In my sleep. O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P. What are you doing? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding! Now.  Get good work done.  Concentrate. On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters] We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine] It's really nice. Uh-huh. So you have an office and a workspace? What a cute bench. Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week. Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it. Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00? [To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party. Montana. Joe Montana! Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback? Oh okay. Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself. You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party. [Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you. Is there more wine in the kitchen? No, yeah. What? Oh, are you joking? I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever. [whispering] Awesome. [whispers] Like... like what? I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover? And now you guys are dating? [whispers] Flooded. [Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe. Hmm? [Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night... [to Jim, quietly] Food! [quietly] Not with your hands. Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite] Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost. It was just a little... Where did you grow up? Wow, you did neighborhood watch? W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get. Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim. Nature. Some of us like the walk more than others. [to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile. But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair. Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it. Her? The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair? Or in a great chair. I definitely remember your dinner party. Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair. [on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet. [to Jim] Who are you putting down? Who is it? Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me. OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you. No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael] I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this. She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along. I know. Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move. Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too. No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged. Hmm, I don't, know... Oh, right now? OK, so then, when? Oh, right, yeah. Ohh kay. I've been warned. Nice job. I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one... [smiling] I hate you. [walks away] Oh, oh. How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that? I don't have anybody. No... Sorry. No, I don't, I... I just... Are you talking about Beverley? Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator. What's wrong Michael? You do. We have peanut butter in the kitchen. No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad. You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left. There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.' I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number? Aw! That's great Toby. Toby, you're the best. Phyllis. I know how to throw a football. Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow. I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles] That's the other Boleyn girl. Shh. Mmm? I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job. Michael we don't know what you're talking about... She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement. [wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up. I don't have my contacts... Don't, don't-- If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no. Oh, thanks. Oh, okay... I should probably get back to... Entering the.... No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message] Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want? Because you're very important? What does that mean? I can't find my glasses. Okay, okay. What kind of stuff does Stanley say? Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly. Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses. Thanks, Phyllis.  Yours, too. Really? Huh.  Maybe I will. What's it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I'll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I'm 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great. Hi, can I help you? [pointing] Ryan! Yeah. Okay. I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor] Okay. Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry. [to Darryl] I think you look nice. So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days! [holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought. There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake! [laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs. This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin. He's nice and he seems interested. I only brought the one. Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that? Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves] My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind. A piece of paper. Well I think they'll get the spirit of it. Are you serious? Okay. Just checking in, how's it going? I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess. Talk to you later? Excuse me. [clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it? Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like] Well done. Hi. I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have? Yeah. Can I fill out an application? I can do that. I don't know any of those. New York or Philadelphia. All right. Cool, well... thanks. And uh, I'll look into those. New York or Philadelphia. Okay. Thanks. Hi, nice to meet you. Hey, is this Dwight? Oh my goodness, you sound sexy. Have you? Dwight? I'm confused... Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral? So how much antigravity potion do you want? Hi, can I help you? Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek] Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design. Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome! I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack. So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months... Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great. Ohh... [they hug; she laughs] I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here! Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica. Well I was taking the picture. Sure, do you have a camera here? Okay... [enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes? Okay. Toby, why don't you open your present? Michael... So what is your gift? What is it? Your watch? I just knew. Is that the police? Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver] Wow. Look at our parking lot. Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he? [everyone applauds] Yay, Phyllis! Song parody writer. I like that one. I like that one. I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office. Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute. Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music] Oh, yeah, um... Sure. Meredith, do you mind? I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight... [to Toby] Thank you! Hey. Did you just buy that? Ahh!  I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in. Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second. Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200... Just, we'll just keep going. Yes. Yes. I have everything. Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212? I should really get going. I'm sure it was really lovely. OK, bye. No, Michael. I'm in the wrong class... Oh, no. I just-- [on computer screen] I can see you! This is so cool. Lunch with a girl from my hall. Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer. Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous? The nerve. They're on the supply shelf. New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please? Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera] What? Really, where? Wow, was it the age difference? Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends! [to friend] Nice. Sorry. You've already disappointed him so much.  He can't be expecting a lot from you. I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right? No football games, recitals, karate tournaments. OK. Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch. What are you doing? Oh my God! Oh my God! Yes! [they embrace and kiss] [on the phone] Well, I should go. No, don't.  I'm mad at them. Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement. What?  Why not? Come on, it won't be that bad. [speakerphone] Hi everyone! Wow. No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves 'hi' at the phone] Sorry. [on phone] So you know Stacy, right? There's no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages. So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab. Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in. No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres. So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box. Yes! No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested. No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can't you just be in art class with me? Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up] Hey you! Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month. I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going- I can't hear anything! OK. I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync.  You know, that's all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick. Hi. [on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message. I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but... I'll leave a message. I guess this is just one of those days.  It'll get better. I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you. And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer? You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don't worry, I'm being safe.  And I'm headed home.  I'm... headed to my dorm.  Not home. Anyway, um... I miss you. Okay, thanks. New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate. Hey. Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week. Hey Michael. What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy. It is.  Thanks again. [long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you... If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even? I know.  And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing?  How can Josh and Sam keep quiet? Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD.  Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised.  Next we're gonna watch Cranford. Hey. Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin] So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler. Hey! How are you Tom. Nice to see you. I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.' Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it. So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring? Okay, okay. Oookay.... They came up with that idea really fast. Hey guys. Hi! [smooches] Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera] Cute. Miles Davis. Chet ...something. Dizzy Gillespie. I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art. I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So... ... Got you. For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better. Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle. Thank you. Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald? [on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work. It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something. We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone. I should go. [listening in New York] I miss him. Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine. [Dwight slams something on desk] What was that? Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon? [whispers on bluetooth] Good luck. I love you. [touches ear] Jim? Jim? Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist. [on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online. [in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. [in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said! [on Bluetooth] That was weird. Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath? Did you do something to her? Well, something's off. Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead. [in New York] Right Dwight is loud. Hey, what are you doing here? It's Alex. Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work. OK. What's up? Wow. Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too. Jim's in Scranton. I'll see you tomorrow. [in Jim's ear] Ask how he's doing since the breakup. Ask if there's anything you can do. Tell him you'd like to go with him. [in Jim's ear] I wonder what else Dwight's been right about.... [at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs] [over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing. I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers. I have to stay and retake it. That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months? [over phone] I know. [starting to cry] Right. [over phone] Yeah I'm fine.  Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go. Alright. [over phone] Love you. Bye. I'm coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you.  I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it.  It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it? I missed you too. [Jim kisses her] Uh, yeah. I'm not going inside. [pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting. Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note? Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one? Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich. When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that. [looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me? Are you inching away from me? Reach your arms out. What do you need, Michael? Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.' Thank you. I know, can you believe it? I guess that's why we have a temp, huh? How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse? You've seen things cleaned before though, right? I don't know anything about that. Here? Sure. [getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house? I don't get it. I love it. Yeah, I love it! I mean, you bought me a house! You bought me a house! Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom? And the clown? New chairs? Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year. [over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good... Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands. Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are. Michael? I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this. What? Jim. Hey. So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing... I really think you should reconsider. Yeah, I know. But I really think you should reconsider. Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right. Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that? Well that never happened. So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on. Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair? Aww. That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage] Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door] Michael? Hey! You got a second? Oh, good. Oh, that must've been so fun. Hey, have I told you you look really nice today? Yeah, is that a new tie? That is amazing! What? No. [applauding] No way! Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier. Yeah. Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day... But not everyone... Or even uses the copier every day. Yeah, right? ...That's it. [giggles] All right, see you later... Hot tie guy. No, copier's great. Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies] And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half] So suck it. There's that ass! Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away! Did somebody call Hank? You can try mine. Yeah, know what? You can do that? You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs? Or chairs? So what's it gonna be? Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me. Hey. Thanks Michael. Yeah, I guess, since I won. I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way. I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs] I knew it. I knew some of it. It's Christmas. Thank you. I knew it. [answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail? Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard. Quick announcement: new year, new candy. Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy. Yeah. So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more... Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now. Of course you will. Oh my God! Have you seen her with her bangs? [disapprovingly] Kevin! Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access. No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation] Hillary swank. [points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God! The phones are dead. Try a different door. What do we do? We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people. But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him. My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe. He's not saying what he needs to say. Yeah. Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom. So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance? Hey. Um, did my dad say anything about my mom? [sighs] I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it. You're good to talk to. What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh... Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say? What did you say to my dad? After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment. What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me? Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses. Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter] Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks. I think he meant personal day. Phyllis there's a package for you. Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then. Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best. Yeah. [they hug] When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous] Michael! It's really good to see you. What? Ugh. Good morning. He brought a sled. Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks. Separate rooms. I'm going to say it anyway. This is a new cardigan. No. Can I turn on the radio? But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do. That's dangerous. That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head. No, that was a long time ago. No, I'm not even wearing that much. I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so... [taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin. Stop it, please. Please cut it out. Michael! No it's not. So when are you due? Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations. Oh, he's cute. What is happening there? [points at picture] It's really sweet. Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged. Thank you. I like her. I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came. Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good. Are you asleep? No, remind me. Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly. Okay, lets go. Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this. We're engaged. Oh, wow, thank you! ... Okay, let's go. So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long. [taking Michael's picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah. You look good. I'm so sorry, Michael. She's not doing it to hurt you. Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but- You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. One step at a time. You can do this. Oh, God. Michael, get off the floor! [whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it- That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump. [pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition. [loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window] No. What? Oh, Michael... You did what? She never sent it to you? No. No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust. Because, she didn't send it to you! I could read it. Yeah, I could read it. Go get your laptop. [to camera] What? I'm not in love with her. [closes laptop] It's deleted. She still has feelings for you. I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over. [nods and smiles] No, we don't need to do that. You mean Tony? Oh, Michael. Good morning, can I help you? I'm sorry, he's not in right now. Shoot. They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine. That is a great idea. [while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really... There he is! Ayyyy! That was funny. This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances. Really, Jim?  On Cupid's birthday? I can't see them when they're on the floor You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael. What do you think? We're in. Anything to get out of that office. Wow,  that's impressive. What? Jim uses a 6 pound ball. Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back. No, you just have little dainty fingers. What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom? Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes. Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries. [looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What? Well, you should cover it with the broccoli. Do you think they dined and dashed? I thought we were having a nice time. Yeah. [exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate] My God. Yep, that, yeah. [on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem. [on the phone] Sure. Uh huh. I'm on the phone. [on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1-- 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional. [sighs] Who's there? Buddha who? Great. Now there's, there's butter on my desk. [Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael. Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages. Jelly beans. You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out. That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial. When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one. Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings] [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet. I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her. [to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic. [going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight. Sure. It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. OK. Not classy. Hi, can I help you? Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat. Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you. Yeah, are you coming out now? This is what you did last night? He just had to wear his tux today. Took him 40 minutes to get ready. [to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here- Oh no. I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad. And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one. Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down. It's really just a regular shaped cake. He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it. Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened? Do you have any leads on a job? Hi. Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes. Hmm? I'm working on it Kev. It'll be ready soon. Is that what 'soon' means to you? Then come back soon. During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.' Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual] No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions. That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do? Hmm... Like Michael Scott Paper Company? Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk. Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know. Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image. Yeah. Good. Mmm-hmm Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier] Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin! I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did. How's it working? Good. I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels... [Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael? Oh no. I'm going with him. I'm going. Michael, wait!  I'm coming with you. Yeah. Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore. Salesman. Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so... Probably. Okay, see you later. Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe] Michael, you were expecting me, right? Are you wearing anything under the robe? This looks great, Michael. Yes, please. ... Square is fine. So, what do you say we get started? I'm full. I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow. Yeah. I'm excited to start the company. We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second. No, I know you are. Just let me have... Oh. Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed - I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff. Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check. I think you should get dressed. Michael, that seems impossible. We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today. Great. No. What? Why? No. We're not gonna hire Ryan. Okay. We'll find him. Really? We have an investor already? Michael, that's fantastic. Hey! We need to get you dressed! I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go! Next on the list - open the mail. No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'... Next on the list --  song parodies. Great. Let's sing it in the car. Yeah. We can do this. [Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram! We have a meeting with an investor today. He can be. Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram. Yes. Yes, it's possible. Michael! What's going on? Hey, Ryan. This wasn't on the list. No. It's not. [looks at list] When did you add this to the list? You get paid by the year at the bowling alley? No. What is he doing? Oh my God. Sorry! Sure. Beat. [mouthing to camera] Nana? It means grandmother. I can't do this. I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle. I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this? We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything. How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you! Yeah. I could work here. I could see this. Are you good? I'm good. Morning Michael! What should we do now? I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet. That is so insulting. Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times. Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other. Shut up! Really! Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop? I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day. Like how? Dyeing my hair blond? Oh yeah I bet. Michael, we can hear you. Okay it's my turn. Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it? You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.' Yeah exactly. It's my turn. Come on! Ryan! Definitely. We could work from home. .... Corner idea? How would we know that? I thought that was your corner. So my corner's the one with the copier? No thanks. Hey I'm here to see Charles. Hey Charles. I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back. Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now. Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people. Personal shopper? Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building. I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable. Hey. Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff. That's as specific as I'd like to be. We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves. Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper. Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen? We already offered free delivery! Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great! A guarantee of what? And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell. I made a sale! Oh! Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face. We're getting pretty good at it. The timeline's messy. I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?' I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to. Mm-hmm. I'm not gonna do that. I'm here. I'm a part of this now. Michael, are you alright? Tell us what you're talking about. We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened. Michael! I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight. [Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat. Oh my God, I think we've been robbed! When are you ever responsible for your actions? It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross? I don't think so, Andy. We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it. You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael? Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar? Do you drink this every day? [an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church. Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy? Yeah, I know what a loft is. Corporate greed? Did it help? When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.' We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do. That's what Michael said. I like it. Steve Martin's not dead, Michael. You want to hear something sad? So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview. Really? Seriously?  Are you being serious? Yes. Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke. No, Michael. We have to come from a position of strength. Mm-hmm. $60,000.00 Are you kidding me? Can you give us another minute please? Michael. Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing? No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer. Agreed.  But that's all, okay. Thank you. That's right. Alright! [whispering] Who is it? [laughs]  Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall? Well, you have good taste. What? Oh, I, um... Thank, Michael. That one's great. What? Mm-hmmm.",ISFJ,Si,Fe
Phyllis,"So what does downsizing actually mean? What? Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it. I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind. Yeah? Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red... Oh, boy... You... Keep me out of it. I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school. I have a sports bra. I'll do it. Live and learn. [whispering] It's about Michael. Dwight, get out of here!! What were you doing in the ladies room?! Why were you peering over the stalls?! You are a pervert! You, are, a pervert! But where would we...go? This says 'Bushiest Beaver'. It's, it's fine. Dwight, get out of here! You can't be in here! Shut up. You're a freak! You are... I'm telling Michael. I'm telling Michael. Michael, Michael. Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me. He was looking at me in the ladies' room. That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room. Write him up or I'll take it to Jan. When? All right. All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand? I'm the same age as you, Michael. We're in the same High School class. Michael! Come on! You don't have to worry. I'm not going to... ...report you to HR. I'll do it. Are you calling me a ho? What do you mean? No. Oh, you say that every time. Oh, boy... Um, The DaVinci Code. Definitely Jim. Come on, Pam. Yeah, I like Oscar. That's great! What are you? A monk? Ass. Mmm-hmm. Thanks. That's the character's name? Sir, you have some messages. They're important. First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me. Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me? Does he die? Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow. Sure. You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry! [singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known... Dwight... Oh, this isn't good. You don't even know what I'm talking about. Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin. Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones? I'm sorry, everybody. I knitted it for you. Hi guys. Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance? Yeah. I'm bringing someone. I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend. Where are we going this afternoon? A furnace? What does the furnace do? Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned. Are you all packed? Maybe Florida. [to Angela] So this is... Oh. Someplace with a pool, then? Michael, you should stay home and rest. Um, I had scoliosis as a girl. Oh, we wouldn't.  We love Stevie Wonder. You're gonna compete against us? 20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way. I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that. I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that... Really? I thought they were pretty... ...and a big walk-in closet. She's real good. I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk. Mistake. That must have been hard. Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck. Isn't he sweet? Really, Oh, they're from Bob again. Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.] I'm gonna go call Bob. Hey. Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures? Oh. Unbelievable. It's unbelievable! Her nephew's in Iraq. What are we supposed to talk about? I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately... I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts... How about pepperoni? When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty? Where do we get those? Yes, it's marijuana. It's labeled. We don't feel that way. He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately. I said no. You're welcome. It's not me, either. Oh I got the 'Save The Date'. Yeah, pretty stationery. Uh, on or off? Okay... [removes glasses] [leaving the room] Excuse me. No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close. Stanley and I are close, too. I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting. I guess so... [whispering to Angela] I don't like you. But I didn't report your snoring- Oh, dear. You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back] Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest. You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you. Afghani. Afghani. Okay, let's do it. Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play. I have an ace. Oh, I have a flush! Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again? Ass. I'm getting married to Bob Vance. No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school. Well with your ties and your matching socks and --- You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it. Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out. [Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow. It's really something. You're kidding... Michael, what will you do? Maybe I'll quit. That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy. Okay that's enough. Well, there is a ball. I'm just saying hi to Bob. What's on your suit? Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people. Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes? Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again. I thought maybe DJ's. Okay, forget it. [walks away] We know the branch is closing; Michael told us. Stanley! [hugs Stanley] Hey, I hear Jim's coming back. I was... [to Pam] I'll tell you later. What smell? Oh, I'll help you find it. What is it? My perfume? Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine. You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie. Oh, we find little times during the day. Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up. I can't feel my toes. I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it? But we invited guests. I thought you said green was whorish. It'll be all right. You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas] I was just getting a snack. OK. Hi. Oh, ok. Cold, huh? Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there? [under her breath] There's another party in the break room. Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars? Sugarplum fairy wands. I'll just go get a ginger ale. Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly... I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs. Where did you save the list of exchanges? But I won't be able to do inventory without it. Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him. We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen. Then how is this 'Amazing Race'? Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.] Do you have a pole? Um-hmmm. It's a big order. Thanks Kenny. Hey, how's Annie? Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person. I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her. You can pay me back later for the makeover. Sort of. He had a lot of clients. No. Sorry. Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive. Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before. Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside. Yes, very. No. That wasn't me. I thought it was... Michael... No. I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone. I do. Thanks Angela. I don't have that, Dwight. It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet. It's fish. You found Uncle Al! Thank you, Michael. Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining? Did you see... Mm-hmm, near the river. Four. Drew isn't a girl... She's Andy. [phone rings] Hello?  Hi Bob Vance. [laughs] You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha. [on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this. I think I just got flashed. In the parking lot. Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map. I didn't really get a good look. Michael. When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian. Oh, it can be fun. She does have very nice clothes. No, the one before that. I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan? My mom taught me that. Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles] Is there any mustard? Well, Bob was going to just drive me. I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute. Is there any mustard? The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs] What are you gonna do? Dwight is our new boss. I think it's gonna be Michael. No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one. Michael, what happened? You shot Dwight? Does it hurt terribly? I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy. Oh, it's coming. That's despicable. That's... Go get him Bobby! Sic him! Sic him! You guys are together? Did you plan it? Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress] Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here. I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK? OK. Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time? Did you even try? I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses] Michael. This is stupid. How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back? Did you get any clients back? Stanley, you're dancing! Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today. So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch? I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful. I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone. Yes. You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this. [Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face] That seemed to shut her up. Yeah, that sounds right. He's always been terrible with money. Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system. Dancing babies! [gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now. Okay. Bye everyone. [crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer. So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends. [sobbing] No. Popcorn. Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn. Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs] Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited. Oh! [Michael laughs] [raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim. [laughing] Thought we were playing for fun. But it's closer to you. Oh, we're in a meeting. Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here? Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves] Michael? I have a friend who's single. Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too. Umm, no, she's a professional softball player. Umm I don't know Michael. What are you asking? No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat. Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it. Did the police solve the problem with the... Elliot. Jim was supposed to collect it. [Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that? Oh. We-- we-- Well-- When I was a little girl... We-we found some wet cement in the park... In our neighborhood... What did we write? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs] I like your frames. Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses. I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go? What consequences? [whispers] Yes. Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines? That's right. Yeah. They make you feel lighter... Okay. Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't... Why would you do that? Really? Hello Angela. Can I get a list of your vendors? Why would you do that? [knocks files off desk] Sorry. Kevin, take your shoes off first! Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real. Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay. Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out] [on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude. Jim, I am so f[bleep]ed. I don't know, I'm not used to the stress. When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure. And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go? Mmm, no Bob, I don't know. It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes. Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite. Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time. It's going well. We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while. Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake. You said fruit, Michael. Cake. Yes you were. Split the commission? [storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?! There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone. You left me in a bad part of town! [into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace. Why should I have to thank him? I like her purple dress. I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs. I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree. Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious. I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it. During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform. Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them. One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back. No. That can't be right. Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower. I know, Kevin. Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake. I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine. Sorry. [sigh] What are you making? You're making a knife with a knife? You want to talk about it? You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know. Hi. It's nice to learn new things. Okay. What don't you get? Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk. No, it's lettuce. Where are we going? Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on. It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much. I think it's a fun idea. We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time. Move on, Michael. It's the only gavel I could find. Oh dear. Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it? Now you move on. Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer. Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us. I have my hug. Okay. [dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you? Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on] Sure. I'm sitting right here Dwight. I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building. [to Stanley] Hey, I did good too! [laughing] It's good! We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight] Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments. On more week. [chuckles] Dwight, stop it. Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic. Where's your place? Ohhh... Hello. Know what? I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have. This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate. Yes. Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme. Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer. I need you to get rid of the tree. Thank you. Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter. It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them. And napkins... fanned. I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore. Oh, sorry, it's your job. You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet? Ok... nice. That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out] I need you to put the Christmas tree back up. I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be. Excuse me? Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party. Wow, thirteen! Why isn't Dwight turning around? Andy's running over Dwight with his car. Dwight, get out of here! You've got no taste Stanley Hudson. Hillary Swank. She's not hot. What-- Oh! I forgot my purse. What in the name of God is going on?! That's not a good idea, Michael. He needs to rest. We bury him? It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley. Let me get you some water. Hey, this is your apology letter. I hope he's ok, I feel bad. Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box] You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday. She's out of your league Andy. Sexually? There's always a theme. Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob. It is so nice to go out with another couple. I know He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy. Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand. Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly] Yes I do. [out of breath] Bowling. Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though. Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera] Damn. Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties. It's just me here. I think he left. Um, let's see... it's fine. Andy He's gone. You don't have to kiss his ass anymore. I never see him drink. I never see him eat. [muffled] No, I swallowed a crown. It's really cute. What's wrong with you? I think you look nice. You sound worried. Andy, I think Jim is messing with you. Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen] Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients. You mean the clients you stole from us. It sure looked good on the mannequin. Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though. Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them? Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout. You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty. Those sound too harsh.",ISFJ,Si,Fe
Roy,"Hey, man. Hey, baby. No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home. It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going. Just tell her I'll talk to her later. [yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert? [looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about? Come on. Yeah, you too. Should be fun. Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car. That's what I'm talking about. OK. All right, let's go. [steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball. What the hell man? No, you take it easy. No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday. Hey baby. [to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend. Yeah? Let's get you into a tub. What? Iverson's not fat. Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh? Why don't you get on that? What are you gay? That's disgusting. [Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam. Engaged, yeah. What's up? Are you still mad at me? Come on [begins to tickle Pam] Come on, you mad at me? Are you still mad at me now? Are you mad at me now? Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding. I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't... [on video] Yes. [on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year. Yeah, let's get out of here. ...talking about? He's a jackass every year. [Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's. Pam. Go. Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up. Boys R Us! Hey, hey, hey. So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad. You look like you feel bad. Little package! You look good. Natural redhead. That's her? No! At the party? How are ya? You look great! Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies? All right, I'll see ya. Hey! Guys, what's going on? What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit? The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes. Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond? Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you. You're all gay. [looks around conference room] You're joking right? Hey babe.  Hey, how are you!? You look good. Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight.  I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while. Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or... Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best! Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning. Alright, bye. [Pam looks around the office] This is awesome. Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money. I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something. I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man. It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man. Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league. Oh, no. That is not worth it. Never. Yeah. No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything! Where did you go to school? Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you? I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10! Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on! Come on! I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die? Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam! No, it was Captain Jack. Yeah! Yes, I have. [kisses Pam] Should have done it a long time ago. I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe. Come on. We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe. Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something. No. [laughing] I think he's dancing. Nope. You mean the thing? [laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad. You ready? Why? I don't understand. Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam. No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right? You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home. So, we're cool, right? All right. Sweet. Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy. I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?' Like next to no benefits. Exactly. That's what I'm talking about. Absolutely. In my truck. Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point. Really? How's that union stuff coming? Yeah. Okay. Hey babe. You almost ready to go? What's wrong? What, you're mad at me? Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life. [wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on! You think you can beat up Darryl? I think you might be able to. So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame. Yeah! That's great. She took you down, huh? Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock. Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding? Whatever. I'm in charge of the music. Sweet. All right. Sorry, babe. I am just beat. Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right? If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right? See you. Chicken or fish? So you havin' a good day? Good, glad.  OK. After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back. [walking into the break room] Hey. You look nice. Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car. [as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session. How are you likin' the new car? Yeah?  Sure is small.  Got airbags? [laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah. Hey there. So how's your day going? That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here. [laughs] Cool, all right. Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you... Sure. Yeah? No problem. I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going? What does that mean? I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words. Crazy day, huh? Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here. So I only use three? OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows? OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper? [Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room] Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses] You don't know? He's in the office. [starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done. That corporate booty, he likes to hit it! Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico? I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother. What's the problem? Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me. I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art. Hey. I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste. I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom. I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning. Sorry about that. You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married. Hey, they're playing our song. I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance? [to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here? I can't for your art show tonight. I-I wouldn't miss it for the world. Love ya. Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh? How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh? It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them. To my place? Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art. I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered. Ok. Hey. You said it was important, so... How's it going? You guys, uh, want a round, on me? Yeah? Get you a drink. One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here. On this side. [points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand]. I can read you like a book. You can't keep anything from me. What? That's awesome. That's what I want. I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all. What? Jim came on to you? No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening! Don't yell?! Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God! Are they going to call the cops? Jet ski money? I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert. [Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that. No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know. Hey Halpert! [screams in pain] Ahh God! [to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something? Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly] I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong. So you gonna start datin' Halpert then? Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy. But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam. Halpert? I'm not gonna hit you or anything. You good? I'm good. Hey Darryl, what's happenin'? Hey, what's up, guys? How you been? What's going on with Pam? Yeah? Really? Huh. [laughs] Congrats, man. So Pam's happy? Wow. I thought you were a friend.",ESFP,Se,Fi
Ryan,"Hey. Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today. Yup. I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know. What's up? Nice to meet you. You should've put him in custardy. Yeah. All right. Uh, Shemp. Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different. Chappelle's Show. I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space. Great. She's cute, huh? Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch. I have something. Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about... What do you want me to do? Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the... Michael? Are you done yet? Yeah. Thanks. No, don't. Don't do that. What? Fine, don't worry about that. Darryl Rogers? Yeah, yeah. But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch? OK. I stretched before I came. Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine. [Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight. I'm installing File Share on all the computers. Yeah. I would love to. You don't want to recycle them? Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water] What about this bottle of power drink? Blue. It says flavor: Blue Blast. No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept. Well, it's empty. Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? [Under his breath] Still. I mean whatever one you want. Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably. What kind do you like? Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock? Okay. Do you like The Strokes? Do you like The Hives? You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps? Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those. Absolutely. You staying? What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now. You a big William Hung fan? I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for? I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts. I did. I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid? The temp agency wants to know what you think. Ah, well, I'm interested in business. Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company. Fozzie bear? Got it. Yeah. Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act. Uh, okay, two? Okay... uh, sorry? No. ...I don't. I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'. Yeah. [to Dwight] Don't... That's actually a test prep book. That's a test prep for business school. I just got in. I applied, I go at night. Yeah. No, not yet. Just started. I... wouldn't even know where to start. All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years? Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer? It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer. I am. I am. It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base. Maybe we should get some air. I'm really uncomfortable. [answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing. What's your number? Um... You got to... you got to give it to me again. Now I have it. I am so sorry. I can't believe I started the fire. I'm really sorry, Dwight. What? No. I'm really sorry, Dwight. Good. What's up? I'm good, thanks. Uh, fine. What's up? Cool. I don't have a tape player. So... For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever. $650 bucks A credit. It's an investment. I think it's worth it. Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just... Did you ask me here for any specific reason? Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office] Updating emergency contacts. Catch-22. What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings] Hello? Do you mean Neverland? What? Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings] [looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up] Hello? Is your wife still your contact? Kay. Fudge? Ok, to what? I have the emergency contacts. Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably. Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday. [entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie. Good. Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans? Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight. Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word. I forget it, brutha. Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes! Is that it? Don't you mean constructive criticism? Yeah. It's another note. Look on the windshield.' I'll check them all. Look under the sink in the men's room.' Hey. Cool. I bet you did. What nerves? Actually, I had mine already. Why would I lie about a performance review? I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping] Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell. Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me. Hey, is Katy coming? Huh, is it ok if I call her? And he's really into penguins or something? That's really funny. He called me Fire Guy. Never gets old. Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive. [unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod. Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks. Yeah, you left the price tag on. Yeah. And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice? Yeah, I figured. Hey. Ryan Howard. What line of work you in, Bob? We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some? Oh, no. I really did not do anything. [looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that? Oh, how did I not guess that? I actually got that for you. I had you originally. I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy. Yeah, Christmas. I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that? I'm already in business school. At home, not on a boat? Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat. Well... [throwing up] Here you go. Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat. They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach. Yes. They had no yams. You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it. Twice. I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale! You are very welcome. No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams! You sure? Ok. I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine. My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott. They were out. At three different places. What's that? Huh? Yeah, I think I can handle it. I think. If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too. Creed did you organize the menu book? No, that was mandatory. People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss? It's from '99. 18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?' Everything seems pretty much under control. How would... Not really. No. [catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What? [again catching Jim looking at him] What? Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me. [barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me. Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair. That's what I told him.  Thanks. [leaves] What's up? What? I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool. Yeah, totally. Did she say something? Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out? Can you find out? How about rainbows? You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line. [anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th. Soda. I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends. Cool. Cool. OK. Yeah. You're inviting Jim? Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married. I know what I said. You really think you're going to go? Nice. Send me a postcard. Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia. Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order? Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else. I got the stamps. The ones that say '39 cents.' I didn't think it did. Kelly's helping? Yeah, sure. Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me. Wow. No. Uhm... Yes, I-- Okay. Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. Right. Okay. Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so... No! I will... go. I like extra cheese. Thank you. Who uses calling cards anymore? [making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing? Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. I won't. Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go. Hey. I got the information. [turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.' [looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.' For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...' The skin is the largest organ of the body.' I go to a lot of parties. I am not giving you my keys. What's the hard way? Yeah, let's do it that way. I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any. Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring? Yeah.  Maybe. Thank you. Um, I don't... Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes. My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes... I know. One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can. Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms. Uh, fun jeans. I don't want ketchup. [reading checklist] Fun jeans. Fourth quarter projections for Jan? Will do. Yeah. [shakes his head] I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to. Uh, no thanks, I'm good. Um...  Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. [catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened. Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story. When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way. A dime and a nickel. But the other one is. I've heard that before. Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother. He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted. It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole. Yeah. Yes. I'm very excited. I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited. So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office? I know where we're not. I don't think you know what you're saying. Uh huh. Gotcha. Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course. Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship. Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it. Yeah. Who was that? Is that your Cousin Mose? Outsourcing and consolidation of competition. Depression? Um, loneliness. Maybe women. No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK. No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye. Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call. Wait, can you go back? Ok, I'm going to establish time frames. I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'. I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers. Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing. I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky. They really didn't like me. I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong. You drive. I think about that all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have a key. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great. Huh. What was that first thing you did? Oh. It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know. You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.' So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh? What? They said something about Zach Braff. No, you don't... Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive. Yes. Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox. Um, yeah. [shakes her hand] Ryan. Hi, nice to meet you. Ah. Yeah. Wow, um... Sorry you had to... It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number. [to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense. This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best. Is Jim coming back. I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk. Oh, yeah, totally. Uh yeah, we'll meet you there. Hey, buddy. Welcome back. I'm good! How are you? So... Yeah. Um... unless you really, really want it back. Cool, thank you. Yuh. Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk. I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting. Sometimes he brings more costumes. Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done. Thanks. They have business classes there? Prison sounds great. Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises] Ah man, I can't. I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead] Thanks. Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back. I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to. Looks like they forgot the power cord. No. Huh? [puts on jacket] [knocks on office wall] Hey. Merry Christmas. [hands over a gift] Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem? Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.] [talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too. I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things. Kelly, I'm so cold! Are you having fun in this relationship? I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think... [both inside dumpster] Did you look over here? Kelly. Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird. No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it? All of a sudden? I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt] We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to. I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.' Is there a prize? Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after? Yeah, if you don't mind. Hi. Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Oh... Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed. What? Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago. Yeah, me too. He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling. Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on? Oh gross. Kelly don't do this. You know what you're doing. Ok. You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class. If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid What? Y-You understand nobody's graduating. ...It doesn't apply. Quit it! ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off... And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott. Michael. What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing. ...It wasn't personal. Pack my--? Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me. To the annex? Where... Kelly is? It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited. Michael it's not... It's not... I think I heard it on Roy's side. [tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here. Yeah, close one. Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's? Maybe. Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating? Hey. I've missed you too... Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym? [at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin. Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened. She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work. I can't imagine what I would have done. Well that was funny, that's why. Mm-hmm. Okay. You know what?  I didn't--- Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night... I don't know what you're talking about. No, I said your idea was stupid. Don't you see why that's insane? What about a long sleeve T? Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize. I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money] Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T? At least we're outside. Totally, we should both work out. Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing. Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career. Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it. F and C, doubletime? I'll go. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. [whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering] What's the occasion? Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up. Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um - I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway. Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore. You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race. That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team. Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain. I know, but I'd like to give this a try. Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking. I don't do that stuff anymore. [on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye. [still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done. Yes Michael? Back? Why is that Michael? Oh! Did you do this on purpose? Did this happen on company property? I don't think you understand how jeopardy works. [sigh] People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word. [Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up] Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in? OK. Should we get started? Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting. Stop that! Stop that! [to Kevin] You scared me. Michael and everybody, umm... ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan. So... OK... Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand? Perfect. Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains. This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use. I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight? This is company-wide, Dwight. Andy. Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor. Thank you everybody. As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system. OK, what's up? Well it is business, but not as usual. No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system. No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself. So, how are you? Good. Kelly... Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend. I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship. OK. OK. I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK? Jan. So elephant in the room, I have your old job. Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities. Well... you look great. Scranton suits you. You were let go. Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here. [notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man. Michael. We're not doing this today. OK. This is... Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second? We have actual work to do. Well, today was a fantastic waste of time. Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving. Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go? Kelly, come on. You don't? You lied about being pregnant. You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry? We're never getting back together. What's, uh, going on here? With gift baskets. Good luck Michael. [speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing. Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn. Literally. ... Later guys. Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo? Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look? Thank you very much. Cool. I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff. I'd love to talk to you about it more. Do you want to go out to dinner tonight? Wear something nice. What? I just... I just wanted to have dinner. You're kidding? That's... great, I... that's awesome. [grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these. Cool. That is not correct. I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars. You should come visit.  The city is... amazing. No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city. No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless. No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds. [to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else. You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor? Can you get me a cold water? That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds] Thank you. I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water. Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30. Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest. Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun. And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott. Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear. Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out. Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan] [steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks] [on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint. I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint. Hold on, I'll get them on the phone. Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'? Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off? Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott. Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint? You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you? I'm your boss. You have another job? You can not have another job if it affects your work here. It did, all ready. Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse. It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need. How long until you actually get this presentation ready? You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever. What? No, it's whomever. Do you really know which one is correct? As an object. Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here. Hello? What? I told you not to call about small problems. That's good. They're creative, you're not. It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant. Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right? But I'm good at managing people who do sales . I'm on Michael. You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this. I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy'] Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call. Take the call, friend. I insist you take your work calls. Hey Michael. I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second. Could we talk off the record? As friends? Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand? Good. That is great to hear. Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working. My favorite branch. How's everybody doing? Love it. Go. I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that. David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right? You did. Yeah. Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding. Ok thanks Michael. I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions. Dwight. This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site. I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O. TBD. Phyllis? Yes, yes they did, yes they did. Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators. It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store. Do you have a question Kelly? You too. Michael let me go. Let me go Michael. Na. Sorry man. But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city. Unreal. Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace. I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour. Michael. What are you doing here? That is so awesome man! And you brought this guy! Aww! I know it's you guys. I'm so psyched you're here! Woooo! Let's get a drink. Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy. Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard. Bottle service ya'll? Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool. Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms? This guy owns his own beet farm. Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean? Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom. Yeah. I don't know, maybe. With vodka, you're the best. Did you want a place where we could meet older women? Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor] [to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard. [to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks. Let's bail. [starts to leave] You're doing it man. Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world? It's inevitable, right? Why wouldn't they let me dance? I don't wanna go back in. This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment] One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have... No. [Dwight starts singing in German] No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do? Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK? Dehydration. Yeah, New York is great. Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Yeah. Not really.  New York is...so great. Yes. No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah. Yeah. No. You're my friend, Michael.  OK? [to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan? How do you live with a franchise this bad? Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance. It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation. This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it. Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright? Yo! Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately. Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it] Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God. The only good bagels anywhere. Same with coffee, and women. I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs. Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.] Congratulations! Don't interrupt. Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website? All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website. Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up] [walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception]. And you got a goatee! Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine? Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny. It's great to see you Kev. I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list. Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community. I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean. All right. [glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list] Kelly. I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed. We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight? That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around. Yeah. [exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan] I did. [at a loss for words] [stands up] Everything.  She's perfect. Oh... Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So... Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too. Two HR reps. Fraud, Jim, Fraud. Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing. Yeah, isn't that messed up? That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of. I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away] Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions. If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on. We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen] Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses? I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing. Gordon Gekko. ... Yeah. Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight. All right. Living in the moment. I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned? What? Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one. Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there. [walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension. This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups] Yeah... Mmmmm... This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups? Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'. Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps] I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps] That's all he wrote? Can I see it? Didn't you two date for like a long time? We're back. I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly. [whispers] Yeah. You're taking two? [kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me? Are you happy you did? [kisses for a little longer]  What's up? Yeah, yeah I'll see them. Yeah, punch him. [as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man. Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation. I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess. Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up. Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse. I--- I would find a way. I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh... [stops kissing Kelly] I can't do this. It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me. That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip. It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you? Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing. I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27. Hey, you. Sixty thousand dollars a year. What do you make, secretary? I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so... What size shoes are you guys? What are those, a men's ten? Where is it? Do you guys want to hear about Thailand? It was indescribable. Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT? You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style. Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space. Pam's better at that stuff How is it insulting to say that you're good at something? I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other. What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop] Yeah I make originals too. Yeah! That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand. You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all. This is from the sun. No don't take that, give that back! I'm gonna make a spreadsheet. Yeah! Go make a copy, secretary. Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education. Rock the house! Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one. Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is. Are we staying til five? I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky. Keep going. [Whispers] Write it down. Oh! We did it ! I can get there. Oh, awesome. Yeah. Finally. Look at that old dude and his rolodex go. We can spend a couple days there. Uncle Dave? That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions. Get off my ass, you hag. We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick. Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy. Most dorm rooms don't even have that. Let's see what a delivery guy costs. Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable. Yeah. Explain what you think that is. I never went to Thailand. I went to Fort Lauderdale. Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though. You've never had Pad Thai. Oh, that's nice. He's bluffing, Pam. Maybe. Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke. That we're having any problem at all. No, man.  You're-- you're fine. Just put it out of your mind. Michael, you  haven't even heard-- We'll have to talk about this. How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000. I would rather have $60,000, honestly. Yeah, discuss these things-- Yes, yes, yes! [whispering] Who is it? Oh, thanks, man. You look so classy in that picture. Tough. You.  Us. It's gotta be because they all want their clients.",ESTP,Se,Ti
Stanley,"Well... It could be out of your hands Michael. Can you promise that? It's just that we need to know. You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you? Fine. How are you? I admire your culture's success in America. Who am I supposed to be? It's collard greens. It's collard greens. There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible. [looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green... Oh, thanks. This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day. What about confidentiality? We all think you don't have a surprise. Why'd you do this? Last year, five years ago... I'm sorry? Why 'of course'? What's that supposed to mean? Oh, my ankle! Oh, actually no I don't Michael. [in pain] Oh. Go away. Hmmm... Is that from the machine that was in your office? I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson. I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out. I think I did. Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember? You said, we could bring our families. I did, my wife's name is Terri. It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael. Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't... So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling] That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now. Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.' A little bit more and I would have had it. Oscar! Ooh. That's one book. You've got two others. Okay, um... Come on people, you know the rules of the game now. Okay. It's called Who Would You Do? I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least. I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account. No. To the. [laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone. Something wrong, Michael? Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision. I don't want to stay until seven again this year. Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday. I don't care. Excuse me? Hi, Michael. No. Are those purchase orders signed? Huh? What? Are those purchase orders signed? Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders... I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account. Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words. Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses. Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact. It's all about my bonus. I'm back. I think I do. I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did. It's fine. Oh, good one. [laughs] I know how to plug something in. [after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly. And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else. All right, I'm done now. Stanley Hudson. Michael. I need to know... What we're doing. You said bring a toothbrush. Is this an overnight? Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow? Not maybe. Yes or no. In January? [storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida. [gives Phyllis a look] I'm not disabled and neither are you. Mailboxes, Etc. Uh hmmmm... . I mean I'm learning nothing. I'm on the phone. What is? Hmm? [on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer? That's not what a hate crime is. ...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye. Yes. A sale. Big. Just big. Big. This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs. Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she... Why would this affect our bonuses? Michael? You said we were getting bonuses. Cancel wallpaper. Way to go, Ryan! Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa. She's in middle school. Mmhmm. What? A little fishy? That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?! Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child! Put that away and learn. Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work. I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall. Mmhmm, happy birthday. These are all the same? Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday? Is that supposed to be me? I do not think that is funny. Hmmmpt. Where did you get these facts? They are not. No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants. And what did you say? Hmm. Excuse me? I didn't say that. We sit close. Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box] You gotta be kiddin' me. [Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise? I am going back to my desk... Annoying. I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters. If you do that, you're going to have to put out. But... why Dwight? How does that qualify him to run a branch? [standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone. We do not wanna hear about this. You have just spit on my face. [throwing ball back] Nope. I will NOT. [throws ball back] No, I'm done. I'm having trouble getting my work done today. I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day. No way. Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line. This is Pretzel Day. Thank you! [takes pretzel] Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day. There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough. I do not know. That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh] I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier. I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word. Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together. Got an hour? I'll try to explain. Trust me. It only gets worse. Fantastic. I'm going back inside. You can't cancel a holiday. What does that mean? Fruity and delicious. I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around. Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with. Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here. My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised. They said I should talk to you. I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check. No. I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through. Then you won't be able to do inventory. I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show. There is a butterfly on this. Why? So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000. Pass. ... I'll take the kid. You want the lead? Mind? Nothing would delight me more. Ah, Julius, how's it goin'? So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard. I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan? Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old! Oh, sure, we talk all the time. No. [Stanley's fork breaks.] Of course. A toaster, you? Unbelievable. Goooood bye. She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks. Hmm, come here much? [at the table] Oh, not again.  Melissa! Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you? No, no, no, no. No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back. You must have been scared out of your mind. Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid. So you and Bob are looking at a historical house? Mm, how many bedrooms? Is it nice outside? Do I need my jacket? Where's my five dollars? I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day. Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about. [on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset? Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot. Okay, you need to stop that right now. Oh, sweet mother of God. Excuse me? I don't care what you call my team. No [crosses arms], the blue team. There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon. Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle] Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis? I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on! Uh, we don't have any safety mittens [growly noises, Jim looks terrified] [to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight. How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus. I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly. Amen. Liquid. I don't want it. Make it 100. No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again. The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns. What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that? You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning. Hello Meredith. I'm... um, Catholic. [on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime? Zero. Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause. So we've got what, another 20 minutes? Hmmm... You ran over an employee. I don't know. If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him. It's too little. Use the phone. I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight] Or him. Yes, please let us know. No I'm not. You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early. We get to go home? You find anything? Why can't you guys do it? Fine. Why are you calling me here at home? Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home? Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up] [on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott. How did Ryan use it? As an object? Is he right about that? I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house. Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you? I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here. I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it. I think it's because of my sales record. Money. Money. Money. Yep, looks that way. Michael?  A word? I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job. I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things. I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die. Why don't you mind your business? Booyah! [laughs] No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball. [kicks ball toward Phyllis] Now it isn't. This is ridiculous. There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card. I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that. When will that be? Did you not tell the security guard we were working late? Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead. [through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so... Somebody's always got to be a hero. Not me. No. Leave me alone, dammit. DID I STUTTER? What. What are you talking about? I am not going to apologize to you. It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too. Are you serious? You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me? I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office. So I'm not fired. Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all? Do you have any idea how to run an office? Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before. And I think, 'there's no possible way-- He can top that.' But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot! Oh, for the love of God. Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way. Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories? Fair enough. Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles] Hmm? Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious. Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs. [chuckling] What a messed up world. When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby. I'm taking the dumplings for my wife. I'm taking my dumplings. Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close] I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted. I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds. I don't like cake anymore Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava. I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway. This meeting. It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things. Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming. About what? No, that was you. I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital? I'm done. Do you want us to look for 'em? What? I knew it. Haha! [they high five] [laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis] Perfect, isn't it? [laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable! Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look] Dwight. Oh my God. I'm with Pam. Chairs. There he is! I didn't hear a phone. It's your job. Eh... I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat] I agree. Mmmm... chewy. There was a car. What's happening? What are you doing? Oh, I do. Some actress, whether shes hot. What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here. I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot. Leave it woman! I'm about to die! Thank you, Michael. It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people... [flashback] Not maybe. Yes or no. [flashback] No way. Uh-uh. [flashback] Are you from another planet? [flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it. [flashback] Did I stutter? [flashback] I'm done. Goodbye. But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die. I'm not sitting in a wheelchair. I'm going to die. Oh, I don't know. I would die. I'm okay with the logic of it. Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket. I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down. Oh my God! Oh my God! Chocolate. It's my bio-feedback machine.. It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down. Yes... No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up] Would ya, would ya step back please Please. A little further. That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again] [laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here. Four Splenda. Are you crazy? Are you out of your damn mind? We're not friends. I didn't think about it. You really like her, huh? [thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her. I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother. I know, I just read it on the sign. Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now. Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy. [backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids. I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off? [clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs? Fantastic. Did you tell him how sick of him you were? Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs? Can't you see I'm urinating? No. No. No I didn't. [holding a crossword puzzle] Yes. Just transfer the damn call. I don't think he even uses the bathroom. I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona. From Argentina. I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more? She's upstairs talking to Charles. I don't know. [They shrug and leave.] So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh? What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price. How is that going to work? New File System'. I am not changing the way I do my files. It's not right.  I don't like it.",ISTJ,Si,Te
Toby,"Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing] I'm sorry. I love their sandwiches. Really? Today? Oh, Happy Birthday. Yeah, I could say something. Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick? It's just a birthday card. There's some right there. Hi, nice to meet you. Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara? Yeah, me too. Eighty-nine. Yeah. A girl. [looks resigned] Hi. Hey, did you go to Bishop Ohara? Yeah, me too. 89. It's just a snack. No. Just the once. Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that. I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award. Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on. It wasn't a vote. You decided. Okay, that is not true. Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you. Michael? Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds. The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy. It's really not a big deal, Michael. And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer... Just to refresh you... . on our policy. Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones. Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later. So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam? Great point. Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back. Uh, yes! I can go over it with you. It's over. Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR. Ok, you know, Michael... No. Well, that would be... Okay, I'm lost. Hey Dwight. Sure. Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly. Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that. I should get back to work. [to Jan] He talked the whole time. So it's like volleyball. Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball... ...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape. Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left. Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious. Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater. Hey, Jim. Michael? Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement. I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York. They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative. I know, Michael. Michael, it's almost 5:00. Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now. You don't need to write 'ex'. Michael... Any word on those time cards? We want to go home. That is unbelievable. Aren't the suggestions meant for you? Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this.  That's why I only use my personal e-mail account. I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that. Well, it's for Angela, so .. We're really not supposed to serve alcohol. So, hey, you wanna trade? Really? You were gonna throw out a book? Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry. Christmas. Hey, Brenda. I got lost. I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner. Wow, you just dive right into it. What, what happened? What do you need? I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room. Ryan, is, uh, dead. Dead. No.  Can't, can't you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot. [on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time. Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward. I'm sorry? Uh, ok. Uh, great.  Why don't we move on? Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call] You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again? I'm not processing this. He seems fine to me. That's no burst pipe. Hey. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. What are you talking about? Yeah. Honestly, I don't even hear her anymore. It's like waves crashing against the beach. Been to Amsterdam. [mimes lifting a glass] To Amsterdam. Umm... After my divorce. Yeah. Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't... [to Sasha] Come on. [to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say. Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw. I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk] Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch. Is everything okay? Uh... it's true... Mmhmm. Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend. Not Jan. If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something. Somehow. Yes. Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email? Who brought in donuts? Happy birthday! I... guess I forgot. Are you serious? [to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible. I don't really think people are in the laughing mood. I work here. Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing. Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael. No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors. You can't do that. That's not random. Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course. You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that. Yeah. Bye. Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today. It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace. Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please? Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen. These things just have a way of working themselves out. It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it. Okay. That was the right decision for me and my marriage. You solved it? Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers] Mmm-Hm. I... I can't do that. That... [shakes head and places hand over the file] [sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's. Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York. Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder] Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off. To your HR representative. Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know. Sure. [sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again] Talk to Michael. I gave him the box. Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going? I'll call. I have good cards. I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling. Frustrating. OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that. No not really... Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie. All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay. I mean for real. No, I mean he's attracted to other men. OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion. OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today? All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault. Michael? What? Really? She's dating? Hey, Pam. It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted... Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird. Okay. Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going. What? It was obvious... Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now. Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to. Is anyone having any trouble eating? Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today? Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk. Michael, I'm sorry... Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, 'Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.' Second? Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these. Yes. Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made. Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you. Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65. Hey. Ah, pretty good. I finished. About seven. Well, that has wheels. Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it? Hey, Jim! Oh, really good. How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump] No, I'm sorry, it's... No, it's nothing. We'll just... [shakes hand] So... okay. All right... sorry... sorry about that. It was just... Nothing. Um... You might want these orientation materials. I don't... I don't think we can do that. [answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from? Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room? Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will. You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny. Oh, Dwight, we talked about this. Dwight, you cannot keep that here. Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour. It's a dead animal in an office. You can't... I'm sorry. Clean it in your car. Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why? Hey Kev. Angela, what do you want me to do? [sighing] Look, it's a free country. If she wants to throw a party... ...using her own money... ...then she should be allowed to. The more the merrier. Oww. That really hurt. I'm writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear? Hey I need to talk to you right now. About you and Jan. Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship. Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now. You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR. All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it. All right, thanks Michael. You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year. Yeah. At the gym. Toby! Yeah! The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open. Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it. Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art. Here. [hands Pam a duck stuffed animal] I was... [takes duck back] Yes. I don't know, you? [whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you. I'm... here, Jan. Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company. Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his... Which is where? Thanks Dwight. Can you stop... There's a bunch of people back here, maybe... Guys... I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius. Where? Alright. No. How would we get home? Hi, Jan. Just preparing for the deposition. This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial. Sure. Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour. Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour. No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty. Well, that'll work. You know, anything that warms you. Sedentary. [Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato. Nice. Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the... What's going on? I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response. I don't think the women in this office - I was at a parent-teacher conference. Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight? I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time. Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30. It's Beach Day... Hey, want my sun screen? Uh-huh. No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies. Yeah. Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs... Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs. Hey! [extremely loud gunshot] I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today. [crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson. Where are we? He couldn't have made it a circle? Hey. Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins] Ohh. Yes, uh some people in the office have complained... ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that. Ok, look the memo is not about you... Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So... Yes. Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two. Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really. Uh huh. Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know? Let's just wait. Technically, he's right. Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy. [gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift. Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked] I just really like you. Have a great day! I wouldn't want to do that now would I? The lady cop acted like she'd never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn't work. Damn it. Yeah. Yeah. I remember. Thanks Kelly. Colorblind. It's out of context.  It's not the same as driving. It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object. To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word. Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael] I spent three years in advertising before I came here. I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic. Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club. Fun? Really? What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins? Did you even read it? Who was the main character? He's gonna ruin everything. I like it just us three.  [very quietly] I don't want it to change. I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen. I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did. Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in] Michael. Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come. Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room] Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside] Michael wasn't invited. [knocks] Hey Jim. Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea. Yeah... My birthday was two months ago. There was no party. Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot. I don't know, I just thought you could include me. I just though you could add me.  I don't see the harm in that. I'm allergic to mushrooms. Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side. Um, can you make it eleven? [nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off] [laughs out loud] Excuse me. Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that? I might have it in here. It's so random that I have it. When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it. No. Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's. Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw. Course you do. More like 'Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday.' [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away] Can I talk to you a second? Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning... Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate. Yeah. He didn't seem like he was joking. Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking... Um, why don't you go ask him that? You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school... I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam Well, you can actually fire him. Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years. But now it's being looked at as more of a productivity issue. I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough. Morning. Good morning, Kelly. Fine. Good. As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day. So this is H.R. This is your desk. Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Hey, Stanley... I want to introduce you to... Hey Michael. I'd like to introduce you to my replacement. Come on. Michael Scott, this is Holly. Nothing. You're-you're not in it. I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica. No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh... I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office] [Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do? Well, we still have to do the exit interview. [Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I... Hi Pam. Stay. I'm Toby. This place, um... I've got some ideas, I guess... Well let me see... I would, uh... I guess everything's okay. I made it this far, right? What's the point? [unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.' Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time. I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door] Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us. Yeah, could we... [hands Meredith his camera] This one right here. It's digital, so just take as many as you want. Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael? It's not. [watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm. This is Jim Halpert... And Pam Beesly. You're welcome. This is a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet for about six years.  It's this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande.  Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I'd get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be. Hey. Hey. Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer. Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture? Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay. Uh, no, that's okay. Okay, okay, I'm going. Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily]  Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where... I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh... ...building looked into... [in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven't seen the beach.  It's nice to have visitors. [on the computer] No, but I'm going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman's amazing... Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs] [on the phone] It was terrible. I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital. Not really. Hi, Micha- Well thanks Michael. Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too. Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine... ...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic. It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found. And uh, yeah, plus it was hot. Are you all right, Michael? Hey guys that's really inappropriate. I'm not going to punch you, Michael. No, why would I punch you? Hey, what is this? Why? Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this. Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this? Don't search my stuff. I have a reasonable right to privacy. Michael! Oh my God! That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on? That is not mine.  I have never seen that before. What is going on here? Of course not! I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael. Did you? You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff. I did leave. Well, I don't see it that way. What? We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers. You'll see. Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking. Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing. Okay you know, this-- this is over. Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow... [on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn? No, No, No.  No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it. This is great.  My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero. Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls. Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll. I was-- I was gonna get the doll. But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- I'm-- I'm begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll. I only have $200. [laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you. Oh thanks.  She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh... No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted. Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch.  And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what? Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan? I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh. You have to stop. [bangs on glass window] Can't you just not look at his feet? Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R. I could loan you a pair of socks. No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.",ISFJ,Si,Fe
